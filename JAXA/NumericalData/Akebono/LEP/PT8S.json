        "Description": "These data consist of ion and electron count rates \ntaken in 18 pitch angle directions and in 29 energy channels between\n10eV and 16keV (electrons) or 13ev/Q and 20keV/Q (ions).  A full \ndistribution is available each 8 seconds.  Through the DARTS/LEP\ninterface, one specifies a particular 10-deg-wide pitch angle bin\nand retrieves tables of ion and electron count rates with columns \nfor the energy channels and one row for each 8-sec interval.  There \nare companiog plots with spectrograms showing count rates vs. energy \nand time, one such plot for each of several ~30deg-wine pitch angle\nbins",
