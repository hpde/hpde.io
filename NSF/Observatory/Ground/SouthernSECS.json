        "Description": "The southern hemisphere SECS observatory is a virtual observatory representing the collection of magnetometer arrays used in the creation of the southern hemisphere SECS datasets. The southern hemisphere SECS observatory consists of ground magnetometers from the Autonomous Adaptive Low-Power Instrument Platform (AAL-PIP) Chain, British Antarctic Survey (BAS), GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ), and the Automatic Geophysical Observatories (AGO) magnetometer arrays. Ground magnetometers contributing to each data file may vary from day to day depending upon data availabiliy. Details on the magnetometer arrays are available at the information URLs listed below.",
