        "Description": "An autonomous adaptive low-power instrument platform (AAL-PIP) chain of six stations has been newly established on East Antarctic Plateau along the 40° geomagnetic meridian, to investigate interhemispheric geomagnetically conjugate current systems, waves, and other space weather phenomena in Polar Regions. These six stations, PG0 to PG5, which host low-power magnetometers (Fluxgate and Searchcoil), dual frequency GPS receivers, HF radio experiment, and run autonomously with solar power and two-way satellite communication, are designated at the geomagnetically conjugate (based on the International Geomagnetic Reference Field) locations of the West Greenland geomagnetic chain covering magnetic latitudes from 70° to 80°.",
