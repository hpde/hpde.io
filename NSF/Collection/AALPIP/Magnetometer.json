        "Description": "The AAL-PIP collection of magnetometers is part of an autonomous adaptive low-power instrument platform (AAL-PIP) chain of six stations has been established on East Antarctic Plateau along the 40 deg geomagnetic meridian, to investigate interhemispheric geomagnetically conjugate current systems, waves, and other space weather phenomena in Polar Regions. These six stations, PG0 to PG5, which host low-power Fluxgate magnetometers, dual frequency GPS receivers, HF radio experiment, and run autonomously with solar power and two-way satellite communication, are designated at the geomagnetically conjugate (based on the International Geomagnetic Reference Field) locations of the West Greenland geomagnetic chain covering magnetic latitudes from 70 deg to 80 deg.",
