        "Description": "This site provides access to realtime and archived\ndata from the multiple SuperDARN (Super Dual Auroral Radar Network) radars.  \nRealtime data, covering approximately the latest month through current day, \nconsists of global ionospheric convection maps (images) for every two \nminutes and made from most or all the SuperDARN radars, plus a movie of the\nmost recent 24 hours of maps updated every 10 minutes.  The data archive\nconsists of northern hemisphere and southern hemisphere global convection\nmaps at 10 minute resolution from 1997 onward, northern and southern \nhemisphere time series summary plots and field of view summary plots from \n1993 onward.  A user name and password is required for access to the data\narchive.  From its web page, \"The SuperDARN community is keen to encourage \ncollaboration with others and to provide access to the data set.",
