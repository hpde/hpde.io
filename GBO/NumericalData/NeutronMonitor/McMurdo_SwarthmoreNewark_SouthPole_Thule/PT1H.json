Includes conditions for use of data and descriptions of processing level. Data are grouped into two sets of files.\n\nSet A contains data from neutron monitors at McMurdo: June 24, 1960 - Present, Newark: July 1, 1964 - Present, South Pole: March 1, 1964 - November 27, 2005, Thule: August 13, 1957 - Present.\n\nSet B contains data from neutron monitors at Fort Smith: October 4, 2000 - Present, Peawanuck: September 14, 2000 - February 1, 2009, Nain:  November 10, 2000 - Present, Inuvik: January 1, 2000 - Present.\n\nDirect links to yearly files are provided for viewing of one or a few years. Also provided is a link to the ftp server where the files reside for direct downloading of from one to the total set of yearly files. On the ftp server, the file naming convention for set A is BRIYYYY.txt. The file naming convention for set B on the ftp site is BRIYYYYB.txt Additional documentation concerning the specific neutron monitors included in each file is provided at the top of each yearly file.\n\nCutoff rigidities (minimum rigidities) given are for epoch 1965 as calculated by M.A. Shea and  D.F.
