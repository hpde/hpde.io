The location of these currents is in geographic coordinates at 10s resolution. The distribution of these currents is not the same as the equivalent ionospheric currents. The UT and date are obtained from the file name. For more information see Weygand et al. J. Geophys. Res. 116, A03305, doi:10.1029/2010JA016177, 2011.",
