        "Acknowledgement": "Please contact the principal investigator (PI) of the VLF/ELF observation, Prof. K. Shiokawa (shiokawa at isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp) before using the data. The valley antennas at Kagoshima was developed by a leadership of later Prof. A. Iwai, Research Institute of Atmospherics, Nagoya University. The VLF/ELF observation at the Kagoshima Observatory had been continuouslysupported by late Takasuka (until 1990) and late Koichi Hidaka (until 2007). Both were the technical staffs of ISEE. H. Kogushi and O. Hayashi made the tape list and digitize the tapes since 2007.",
