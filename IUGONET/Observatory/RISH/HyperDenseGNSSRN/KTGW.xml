         <Description>This station is one of the hyper-dense Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver network observatories located near Uji, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 135.77E, 23.9 m MSL) in the middle latitude. In this station, the GPS receiver has been installed in order to monitor the variation of precipitable water vapor (PWV) associated with sever rain. The Hyper-dense GNSS receiver network stations consist of 17 dual-frequency GNSS observatories with a horizontal spacing of 1-2 km. The GNSS stations can receive the signals from both the GPS and QZSS satellites. Moreover, automatic weather stations which measure the pressure and temperature are also installed. These atmospheric parameters are required to estimate the PWV. Details of the GNSS stations have been descrobed in the paper [Sato et al., A high-resolution, precipitable water vapor monitoring system using a dense network of GNSS receivers, J. Disaster Res., 8, 37-47, 2013].</Description>
