        "Description": "Magnetic field data with 1sec resolution from the induction magnetometer at Syowa Station, Antarctica. The data is originally measured at 0.05sec intervals and stored together with the magnetic field from the fluxgate magnetometer, CNA from the broad-beam riometer, and ELF/VLF emissions from the 9-channel ELF/VLF receiver.",
        "Acknowledgement": "Please contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Akira Kadokura (kadokura [at] nipr.ac.jp), National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) before using the data at any publications and/or presentations. We welcome collaborative research and strongly recommend users to contact us early in order to ensure that the data are suitable for their research. When the data are used at any publications and/or presentations, we would like to ask the users to acknowledge NIPR and send us one copy of the reprints. An example of the acknowledgement statement is as follows: \"Magnetic field data were provided by National Institute of Polar Research, Japan. The Upper Atmosphere Physics Monitoring Observation at Syowa Station was mainly supported by the Research Program of Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT).\"",
