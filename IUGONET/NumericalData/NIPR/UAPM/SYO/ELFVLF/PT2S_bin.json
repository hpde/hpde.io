        "Description": "Natural electromagnetic wave emissions at 9 fixed ELF/VLF frequency bands measured at 2sec intervals with the 9-channel ELF/VLF receiver at Syowa Station, Antarctica. The data is stored together with the magnetic field from the fluxgate magnetometer, CNA from the broad-beam riometer, and the magnetic field from the induction magnetometer.",
        "Acknowledgement": "Please contact the Principal Investigator, Dr. Hisao Yamagishi (yamagisi [at] uap.nipr.ac.jp), National Institute of Polar Research (NIPR) before using the data at any publications and/or presentations. We welcome collaborative research and strongly recommend users to contact us early in order to ensure that the data are suitable for their research. When the data are used at any publications and/or presentations, we would like to ask the users to acknowledge NIPR and send us one copy of the reprints. An example of the acknowledgement statement is as follows: \"ELF/VLF electromagnetic wave emission data were provided by National Institute of Polar Research, Japan. The Upper Atmosphere Physics Monitoring Observation at Syowa Station was mainly supported by the Research Program of Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition (JARE) of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan (MEXT).\"",
