        "Description": "Magnetic field measured with the induction magnetometer at Aedey, Iceland. The data consist of variations of three-dimensional (H, D, and Z components) geomagnetic field taken with a sampling rate of 2 Hz, and some engineering parameters for the instrument, such as the sensitivity and phase difference. (As of July 2013, the engineering parameters are invalid.) The digital data are distributed in the Common Data Format (CDF).",
