Yumoto, Kyushu University (yumoto at serc.kyushu-u.ac.jp) before using the data at any publications and/or presentations. 2. Please ask the PI about the authorship of the publication/presentation. The PI should be included as a coauthor if the 210MM data are presented in the publication/presentation. The PI may also ask to include some Co-I(s) as coauthors in the publication. 3. Please cite Yumoto et al. (1992) and/or Yumoto et al. (1996) in the publication. The detailed citation is: * Yumoto, K., Y. Tanaka, T. Oguti, K. Shiokawa, Y. Yoshimura, A. Isono, B. J. Fraser, F. W.

These three issues are essentially important for continuation of our widely-deployed 210MM magnetometer chain. If a manuscript with the 210MM data is prepared for publication without considering these rules, PI may ask the journal editor to withdraw the manuscript. 5. For the hdz_1sec variable, channels 1, 2, and 3 correspond to the H, D, and Z components, respectively, in most cases. However, this is not the case with some stations and some periods. For more information, see http://stdb2.isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/mm210/error.html. 6. For the data from the stations in the northern hemisphere, [H:+ = northward] [D:+ = eastward] [Z:+ = downward], and for the data from the stations in the southern hemisphere, [H:+ = northward] [D:+ = eastward] [Z:+ = upward]. However, this is not the case with some stations and some periods. For more information, see http://stdb2.isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/mm210/error.html. 7. These data are obtained by averaging sixty 1-sec sampled data (One-min data at 00h01mUT is an average of 00h00m30s-00h01m29sUT), with an exception that the one-min data at 00h00mUT is an average of 00h00m00s-00h00m29sUT.)",
