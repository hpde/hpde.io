        "Acknowledgement": "\"We would like to present the following two guidelines. The 1st one concerns what we would like you to do when you use the data. 1. Tell us what you are working on. If your project coincides with one that core team members are working on, that can lead to a fruitful collaboration. This will also work as a way for you to gain better insights into the IPRT data. The 2nd one concerns what you do when you make any presentations and publications using the data. 2. Co-authorship: When the data forms an important part of your work, we would like you to offer us co-authorship. 3. Acknowledgements: When you write a paper, please inculde the following sentence: \"\"IPRT(Iitate Planetary Radio Telescope) is a Japanese radio telescope developed and operated by Tohoku University.\"\" You should also refer the following two papers in your reference list. 4. Entry to publication list: When your paper is accepted, or when you make a presentation at a conference on your result, please let us know by sending email to \"\"misawa(at)pparc.gp.tohoku.ac.jp\"\".\"",
