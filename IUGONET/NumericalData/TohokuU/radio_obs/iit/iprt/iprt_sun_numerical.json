        "Acknowledgement": "\"We would like to present the following two guidelines. The 1st one concerns what we would like you to do when you use the data. 1. Tell us what you are working on. This is partly because to protect potential Ph.D. thesis projects. Also, if your project coincides with one that team members are working on, that can lead to a fruitful collaboration. This will also work for you to obtain better insights relating to the data. The 2nd one concerns what you do when you make any presentations and publications using the data. 2. Co-authorship: When the data forms an important part of your work, we would like you to offer us co-authorship. 3. Acknowledgements: All presentations and publications should carry the following sentence: \"IPRT(Iitate Planetary Radio Telescope) is a Japanese radio telescope developed and operated by Tohoku University.\" 4. Entry to publication list: When your publication is accepted, or when you make a presentation at a conference on your result, please let us know by sending email to PIs.\"",
