        "Acknowledgement": "Scientists who want to engage in collaboration with ICSWSE should contact the project leader of MAGDAS/CPMN observations, Dr. A. Yoshikawa, Kyushu Univ., who will organize such collaborations. There is a possibility that the PI of MAGDAS will arrange offers so that there is less overlapping of themes between MAGDAS research groups. Before you use MAGDAS/CPMN data for your papers, you must agree to the following points; 1. Before you submit your paper, you must contact the PI and discuss authorship. 2. When you submit your paper after doing the above item 1, you must mention the source of the data in the acknowledgment section of your paper. 3. In general, you must use the following references: (i). Yumoto, K., and the 210MM Magnetic Observation Group, The STEP 210 magnetic meridian network project, J. Geomag.

Z is vertical component (downward positive). Our observation system can keep time accuracy within 0.1 second. However it depends on the receiving condition of radio wave at observatory. Pay attention to use of our data, especially in a study affected by time accuracy. Our recording system cannot record quick variation more than about 2nT/3sec (corresponds to 40nT/min). There is not a problem for use of data in usual variation, but attention is necessary for use of data at SC.",
