        "Description": "The all-sky television camera (ATV) is a panchromatic high-sensitivity camera recording all-sky auroral images at 30 frames/sec. Until JARE39 (the 39th Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition), a silicon intensifier target (SIT) tube had been used as a light-receiving element. During JARE40, the light-receiving element was changed to a night viewer (Hamamatsu C3100R) and an analog CCD camera, and the installation location was moved from a roof to an optical dark room. The light receiving section consists of a fish eye lens (Fisheye-Nikkor 8mm, F2.8), the night viewer, a relay lens, and the CCD analog camera (Tokyo Electronics CS8300 or Hamamatsu C3077-70). CCD images are recorded at a video rate of 30 frames/sec using S-VHS (until JARE45) or a HDD/DVD recorder (after JARE46).",
