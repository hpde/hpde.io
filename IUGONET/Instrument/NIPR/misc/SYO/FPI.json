        "Description": "Fabry-Perot Doppler Imager (FPI) observes the two-dimensional distribution of the wind speed and temperature at optical emission height by measuring Doppler shift and Doppler width of the auroral oxygen atom emission line. An ultimate FPI was installed by JARE-42 in 2001 in the optical observation building at Syowa Station. FPI consists of the optical part, control part and recording part. The optical part consists of a fish-eye lens, relay lens, focus lens with Fabry-Perot interferometer, and CCD camera. The control part consists of a FPI controller and a PC to control the filter, shutter, and mirror operation and obtain status information about temperatures. The recording part consists of another PC to control the CCD camera, process the CCD signal, and record the data on HD.",
