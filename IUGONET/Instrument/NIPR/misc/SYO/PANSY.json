        "Description": "PANSY radar is a large Doppler radar built for atmospheric observation at Syowa Station (69S, 40E) in the Antarctic. The construction was started in December 2010, and the quarter system has been in operation from February 2012. After September 2015 the full system is basically continuously in operation. The PANSY radar consists of 1045 three-element Yagi antennas with supplementary 24 Yagi antennas served for field align irregularity observations. The antenna was initially arranged in a circular array but after the heavy snow accumulation in 2011 the arrangement has been changed in a current form which has several patches in a ~300 m x 300 m area. It is an active phased array system with each Yagi driven by a solid-state transceiver module. This system configuration makes it possible to direct the antenna beam by electronic control up to 5,000 times per second. The PANSY radar transmits an intense radio wave of 47.0 MHz upward and receives extremely weak echoes scattered back by atmospheric and ionospheric turbulences. It can observe winds and turbulence in the altitude range from 1.5 km to 500 km including the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and ionosphere.",
