        "Description": "All-sky imager (ASI) consists of a 180° field-of-view lens (f = 6 mm, F = 1.4), an automated filter changer, and a back-illuminated air-cooled CCD camera with a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels. Calibration of the absolute luminosities was carried out with a 1.9 m integrating sphere at National Institute of Polar Research in Japan.",
