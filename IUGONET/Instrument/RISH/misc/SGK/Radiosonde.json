        "Description": "The radiosonde balloon sounding system at Shigaraki MU observatory, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL) was provided by Vaisala (radiosonde type RS80 or RS92) with an automatic signal processor (DigiCORA-III until May 2004, and MW 21 since June 2004). In order to obtain the vertical structure of the atmosphere up to ~30 km, TA600 or TX1000 type balloons have been manufactured by the TOTEX corporation. In the observations using the RS92 type radiosonde as a transmitter, the horizontal location of the balloons was measured by means of GPS navigation. Then, the horizontal wind velocity is calculated from time derivative of the horizontal displacement of the balloon. With the above system, the vertical profiles of pressure, temperature, humidity and horizontal wind in the lower atmosphere from the troposphere to lower stratosphere were obtained.",
