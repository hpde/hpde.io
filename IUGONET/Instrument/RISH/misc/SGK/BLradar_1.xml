         <Description>The boundary layer radar (BLR)-1 at Shigaraki in the Shiga prefecture, Japan (34.86N, 136.11E, 385m MSL) was operated at the frequency of 1357.5 MHz with a peak transmitted power of 1 kW. This instrument was originally developed in Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere (RISH), Kyoto University and Mitsubichi Electric Corporation, in order to measure the wind velocity in the atmospheric boundary layer. The three parabolic antennas of the BLR-1 with a diameter of 2 m are fixed toward three different directions in order to observe the three components of the wind velocity. This BLR-1 was transported to the Serpong observatory in Indonesia (6.36S, 106.65E, 50m MSL) after test measurement of the wind profile at Shigaraki. The test measurement period was from April 13 to August 29, 1992. The basic configuration of the transmitting and receiving apparatus and the signal processor has been described in the two papers [Hashiguchi et al., Radio Sci., 30, 1043-1053, 1995; Hashiguchi et al., J. Meteor. Soc. Japan, 73, 535-548, 1995].</Description>
