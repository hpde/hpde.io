        "Description": "The X-band weather radar at Kototabang in West Sumatra, Indonesia (0.20S, 100.32E, 865m MSL) is a pulsed Doppler radar to measure three-dimensional structure of rain field over a range of several tens of kilometers. A circular parabola antenna mounted on a shelter has the diameter and weight of 1.2 m and 250 kg, respectively. This antenna rotates with 2 revolutions per minute (RPM) and 16 elevation angles. It takes 8 minutes to make a volume scan. The XDR transmits a radio wave of 9.74 GHz with the peak power and pulse length of 40 kW and 0.5 micro sec, respectively, to the sky, and receives the scattered echoes back by atmosphere with a sampling range of 0.25-31.5 km (0.25 km interval). The major system parameters are summarized in the web page in Japanese (http://www.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ear/x-radar/index.html).",
