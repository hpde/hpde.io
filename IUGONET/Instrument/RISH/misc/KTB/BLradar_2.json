        "Description": "The boundary layer radar (BLR)-2 at Kototabang, Indonesia (0.20S, 100.32E, 865m MSL) was operated at the frequency of 1357.5MHz with a peak transmitted power of 1kW from August 8, 1998 to December 19, 2003. The BLR-2 was originally developed in Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and Kansai Environmental Engineering Center by modifying the BLR-1, Kyoto University, in order to measure the wind velocity in the atmospheric boundary layer. One parabolic antenna with a diameter of 2 m is changed toward three different directions in order to observe the three components of wind velocity. Moreover, the absorption screen of electromagnetic waves was installed around the parabolic antenna to reduce the influence of a ground clutter echoes, and, in addition, the fence was set up around the antenna device. The basic configuration of the transmitting and receiving apparatus and the signal processor is the same as the BLR-1 which is installed at Serpong [Hashiguchi et al., Radio Sci., 30, 1043-1053,1995; Hashiguchi et al., J. Meteor. Soc. Japan, 73, 535-548, 1995]. The BLR-2 has measured the wind velocity in the equatorial lower troposphere since August 1998 [Renggono et al., Ann. Geophys., 19, 889-897, 2001]. Observation by the BLR-2 finished on December 19, 2003, and the BLR-3 observation started on December 25, 2003.",
