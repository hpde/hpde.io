        "Description": "The boundary layer radar (BLR)-1 at Serpong, Indonesia (6.36S, 106.65E, 50m MSL) has been operated at the frequency of 1357.5 MHz with a peak transmitted power of 1 kW since November 2, 1992. The BLR-1 was originally developed in Research Institute for Sustainable Humanosphere (RISH), Kyoto University and Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, in order to measure the wind velocity in the atmospheric boundary layer. This instrument was transported from the Shigaraki MU Observatory in Shiga prefecture, Japan (34.85N, 136.10E, 385m MSL) after test measurement of the wind profile (from April 13 to August 29, 1992). The three parabolic antennas of the BLR-1 with a diameter of 2 m are fixed toward three different directions in order to observe the three components of wind velocity. The basic configuration of the transmitting and receiving apparatus and the signal processor has been described in the two papers [Hashiguchi et al., Radio Sci., 30, 1043-1053, 1995; Hashiguchi et al., J. Meteor. Soc. Japan, 73, 535-548, 1995].",
