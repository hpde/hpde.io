        "Description": "The meteor wind radar at Serpong, Indonesia (6.36S, 106.65E, 80m MSL) has been operated since October 27, 1992, and measures the reflected VHF radio wave from an ionized meteor trail at 70-110 km altitude produced by interaction between a meteorite and the neutral atmosphere. Since the meteor trail drifts following the motion of the ambient neutral atmosphere, radial wind velocity can be determined by using a Doppler signal. Basic parameters of this meteor radar system consist of operating frequency (31.57 MHz), beam directions (45 degrees off the zenith), transmitter of peak power (~10 kW), averaged power (~0.5 kW) and bandwidth (~400 kHz) (pulse width: 10 micro sec). One and three five-element Yagi antennas were employed for transmitting and receiving antennas, respectively, where the latter compose an interferometer for accurate determination of echo arrival angle. Details of the meteor wind radar at Serpong have been found in the paper [Tsuda et al., JMSJ, 73, 393-406, 1995].",
