        "Description": "The MF radar at Pontianak, Indonesia (0.00S, 109.36E) has been operated at the frequency of 1.98 MHz with a peak transmitting power of 25 kW since November 1995. A single pulse with a duration of 25 micro sec is transmitted at a repetition cycle of 80 Hz. The transmitting antenna is a square array of four half-wave dipole antennas raised 20 m above the ground. Three receiving antennas, each consists of a crossed dipole at 10 m elevation, are located at an apex of an equilateral triangle with a side length of about 180 m. Using the spaced antenna method, the MF radar measures the wind velocity in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (60-110 km) with a sampling rate of approximately 2 minutes. The upper limit of observation altitude depends on electron density in the ionosphere. The data acceptance rate is high in the altitude region from 78 to 98 km, with the highest data rate at around 90 km. Details of the MF radar at Pontianak have been found in the papers [Vincent and Lesicar, GRL, 18, 825-828, 1991; Tsuda et al., EPS, 51, 579-592, 1999].",
