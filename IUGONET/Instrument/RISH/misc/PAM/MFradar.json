        "Description": "The MF radar at Pameungpeuk, Indonesia (7.64S, 107.69E) has been operated at the frequency of 2.008 MHz with the peak power of 30 kW since March 24, 2004. The antenna array of the MF radar, which consists of three antennas in an equilateral triangle shape, is used for both transmission and reception. Using the spaced antenna method, the MF radar measures the wind velocity in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (52-122 km) with a sampling rate of approximately 1.5 minutes. The upper limit of observation altitude depends on electron density in the ionosphere, and is 98 km (day) and 122 km (night). The data acceptance rate is high in the altitude region from 80 to 98 km, with the highest data rate at around 90 km. Details of the MF radar at Pameungpeuk have been described in the papers [Sridharan et al., JMSJ, 84, 295-304, 2006; Sridharan et al., JMSJ, 86, 43-55, 2008].",
