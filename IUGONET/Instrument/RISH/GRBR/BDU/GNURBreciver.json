        "Description": "The GNU radio beacon receiver installed at Bahir Dar, Ethiopia (11.57N, 37.40E, 1798m MSL) is a simple digital receiver that was developed for the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite ground beacon experiment to measure the ionospheric total electron content (TEC). The open-source software toolkit for the software defined radio, GNU Radio, is utilized to realize the basic function of the receiver and perform fast signal processing. This software is written in the Python language for a LINUX PC. The open-source hardware called Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), which best matches the GNU Radio, is used as a front-end to acquire the LEO satellite beacon signals of 150 and 400 MHz. Detailed information of design and software source codes has been found in the GRBR homepage at the URL http://www.rish.kyoto-u.ac.jp/digitalbeacon/.",
