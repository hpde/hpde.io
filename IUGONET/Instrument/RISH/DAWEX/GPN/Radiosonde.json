        "Description": "The radiosonde balloon sounding system at Pirlangimpi (Garden Point) on Melville Island, Australia. It measures the vertical profiles of the atmospheric parameters (pressure, temperature, and relative humidity etc) from the troposphere to the stratosphere. The observation system was provided by Vaisala (radiosonde type RS80) with an automatic signal processor (DigiCORA; type MW15). In order to obtain the vertical structure of the atmosphere up to ~30 km, 800 g balloons were used. The horizontal location of the balloons was measured by means of the GPS navigation at the Garden Point. Then the horizontal wind velocity was calculated from time derivative of the horizontal displacement of the balloon. Details have been described in the paper [Tsuda et al., JGR, 109, D20S03, doi:10.1029/2004JD004946, 2004].",
