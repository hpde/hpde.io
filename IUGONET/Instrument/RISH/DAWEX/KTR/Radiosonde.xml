         <Description>The radiosonde balloon sounding system at the Katherine civilian airport, Australia (14.5S, 132.5E) during Darwin Area Wave Experiment (DAWEX, Oct-Dec 2001) was provided by Vaisala (radiosonde type RS80) with an automatic signal processor (DigiCORA; type MW15). In order to obtain the vertical structure of the atmosphere up to ~30 km, 800 g balloons were used instead of 350 g balloons usually used in the Australian bureau of Meteorology. The horizontal location of the balloons was measured by means of GPS navigation. Then, the horizontal wind velocity is calculated from time derivative of the horizontal displacement of the balloon. With the above system, the vertical profiles of pressure, temperature, humidity and horizontal wind from the troposphere to lower stratosphere were obtained. Details of the radiosonde balloon sounding system have been described in the paper [Tsuda et al., JGR, 109, D20S03, doi:10.1029/2004JD004946,2004].</Description>
