        "Description": "The GPS receiver which has been installed at Yuto Elementary School, Kyoto Prefecture (34.86N, 135.73E, 13.5 m MSL) detects the electromegnetic signals from both the GPS and Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) satellites. This instrument consists of antenna, RF block, and base-banded IC. By analyzing the propagation delay of the electromegnetic signals from the GPS and QZSS satellite, we investigate the variation of precipitable water vapor (PWV) in the troposphere associated with several meteological phenomena. Details of the Hyper-Dense GNSS Receiver Network stations and PWV estimation method have been described in the paper [Sato et al., A high-resolution, precipitable water vapor monitoring system using a dense network of GNSS receivers, J. Disaster Res., 8, 37-47, 2013]",
