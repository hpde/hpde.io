        "Description": "Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) settled at Tromsoe, Norway, which is a part of The Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTIs). FPI measures thermospheric and mesospheric neutral winds and temperatures through the airglow/aurora emissions at wavelengths of 630.0 nm (thermosphere) and 557.7 nm (mesosphere). Details are described by Shiokawa et al. (2012) which are available at http://stdb2.isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/omti/paper/paper.html. The OMTIs were developed at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, in order to investigate the dynamics of the upper atmosphere through nocturnal airglow emissions.",
        "Acknowledgement": "Please contact the principal investigator (PI) of the OMTIs, Prof. K. Shiokawa (shiokawa at isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp) before using the data.",
