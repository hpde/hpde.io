        "Description": "Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager (SATI) settled at Shigaraki Observatory, which is a part of The Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTIs). It measures temperature of the mesopause region by measuring O2 Atmospheric band and OH Meinel band emissions in every 4 minutes. It starts observation from Dec. 1997 and ended in 2012. The OMTIs were developed at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, in order to investigate the dynamics of the upper atmosphere through nocturnal airglow emissions.",
        "Acknowledgement": "Please contact the principal investigator (PI) of the OMTIs, Prof. K. Shiokawa (shiokawa at isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp) before using the data.",
