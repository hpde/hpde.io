        "Description": "Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) settled at Shigaraki Observatory, which is a part of the Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTI). The FPI measures neutral winds in the mesosphere (Oct.2000-Feb.2011) and thermospheric (Oct.2000-) through the airglow emissions at wavelengths of 630.0 nm and 557.7 nm, respectively. Current and historical configuration of the FPI/OMTIs are available at the Information URL. Details are described by Shiokawa et al. (2003, 2012) which are available at http://stdb2.isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/omti/paper/paper.html. The OMTIs were developed at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, in order to investigate the dynamics of the upper atmosphere through nocturnal airglow emissions.",
        "Acknowledgement": "Please contact the principal investigator (PI) of the OMTIs, Prof. K. Shiokawa (shiokawa at isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp) before using the data.",
