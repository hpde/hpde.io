        "Description": "The tilting photometer (No.1) settled at Shigaraki Observatory, which is a part of the Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTIs), meaures airglow emissions at OH (846.5 nm and 843 nm) lines in every 10-minutes and OI (557.7 nm) line in every 1-minute. This meridian-scanning is for five zenith angles from -74.88 (deg., northward) to +74.88 (deg., southward). Line spectra at the scan angle of 0 (deg., zenith) is also obtained every hour. It starts observation in 1998 and continues observation. The OMTIs were developed at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, in order to investigate the dynamics of the upper atmosphere through nocturnal airglow emissions.",
