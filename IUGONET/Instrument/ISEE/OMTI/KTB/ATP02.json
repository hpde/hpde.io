        "ReleaseDate": "2013-11-28T00:00:00",
        "Description": "The Airglow Temperature Photometer (ATP, #2) settled at Kototabang, which is a part of the Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTIs), meaures airglow intensities and rotational temperatures of OH and O2 at the zenith of the sky. It also measures OI (557.7 nm, 630.0 nm, 777.4 nm) lines and Na line intensities in every 5.5 minutes, and 427.8 nm and 486.1 nm line intensities in every 32.5 minutes. The observed period at Kototabang with #2 is for 22 Oct. 2005 - 7 Jun.2006. The OMTIs were developed at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, in order to investigate the dynamics of the upper atmosphere through nocturnal airglow emissions.",
        "Acknowledgement": "Please contact the principal investigator (PI) of the OMTIs, Prof. K. Shiokawa (shiokawa at isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp) before using the data.",
