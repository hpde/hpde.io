        "ReleaseDate": "2013-11-28T00:00:00",
        "Description": "The tilting photometer (No.3) settled at Rikubetsu, which is a part of the Optical Mesosphere Thermosphere Imagers (OMTIs), meaured airglow emissions at Hbeta (485.1 nm) line in every 10-minutes and N2+ first negative (427.8 nm) line in every 10-minute. This meridian-scanning is for three zenith angles from -74.88 (deg., northward) to +74.88 (deg., southward). Line spectra at the scan angle of 0 (deg., zenith) is also obtained every 10-minutes. It starts observation at Rikubetsu in 1 October 1998 (was at Shigaraki before September 30 1998) and continued observation till Nov. 2004. (No.3 was moved to Athabasca from Sep. 2005.) The OMTIs were developed at the Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, in order to investigate the dynamics of the upper atmosphere through nocturnal airglow emissions.",
