            <Description>As of this writing (11/5/2010), this product 
had been issued by the IBEX team in two releases. 
Release 1 IBEX-Hi map data are superseded by Release 2
data which are more time-extensive (12 months vs. 6 months)
and are richer in content.  While Release 1 IBEX-Hi map data 
and their documentation remain accessible at
ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/ibex/hi/maps/digital_data/release_1/
and
ftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/ibex/hi/maps/images/release_1/,
this description supports the retrieval and use of Release 2 data only.

The Release_2 IBEX-Hi map data contain all-sky 6 deg x 6 deg 
resolution maps in J2000 ecliptic coordinates of energetic 
neutral fluxes reaching the near-Earth IBEX spacecraft from 
the distant heliosphere and heliosheath.  Maps 
are in both a spacecraft frame and, via Compton-Getting 
corrections, a heliospheric frame.  Basic maps are each 
accumulated over 6-months duration, so far for epochs 1 
(12/2008-06/2009) and 2 (06/2009-12/2009).  Maps are available 
for five of the energy bands of IBEX-Hi (0.52-0.95, 0.84-1.55, 
1.36-2.50, 1.99-3.75, 3.13-6.00 keV) and, for the heliospheric 
frame only, also for six monoenergetic points (0.71, 1.11, 1.74, 
2.73, 3.0, 4.29 keV).  In addition, monoenergetic maps are available
as summed over the data collected during epochs 1 and 2 combined.
All maps are available in digital text format and in PNG image format
(considered as separate data sets within VEPO).

Given that VHO/VEPO typically displays clickable granule (file)
names for any given specification of data product and time span,
and given that IBEX-Hi digital maps and PNG-formatted display
maps are each considered single data products, a request for data
from either product will yield .GE.20 names of files containing data
spanning or within the requested time span.  For IBEX, the names
shown by VHO/VEPO actually have the form subdirectory/filename.
The subdirectories are named map1, map1cg, map2, map2cg, and
map-combined.  Maps involving "1" ("2") are from the first (second)
6-month epoch, while "combined" means composed of data taken
during epochs 1 and 2.  Maps involving (not involving) "cg" means
heliospheric frame (spacecraft frame).  In the first four subdirectories,
file names are of the forms ha60.hide-trp-flux100-hi-N-flux.ext and
ha60.hide-trp-mono_80-P.PP-flux.ext, where "ext" is "png" or "txt"
according to which product is requested,  N is the energy step
number for the IBEX-Hi instrument (2-6), P.PP is the energy level,
in keV, of a monoenergetic flux.  Files in the "combined"
subdirectories are named "combined-P.PP-flux.ext, where P.PP
has the same meaning as above.

In addition to the flux maps to which VEPO provides access, 
several map files whose data support the determination of the 
fluxes are also available in the underlying nssdcftp directories 
and are described by aareadme files there (and by IBEX web pages
