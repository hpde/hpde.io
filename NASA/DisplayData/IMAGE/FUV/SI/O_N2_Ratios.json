        "Description": "This data set consists of images of thermospheric\nO/N2 column density ratios at 2-min resolution during times of strong\ngeomagnetic storms (Dst.LT.-80nT) of 2000-2005. The ratios are generated\nfrom dayside airglow observations of the IMAGE Far Ultraviolet (FUV)\nSpectrographic Imager (SI).  The SI has a peak response at the OI 135.6 nm\noxygen emission line and a bandpass of 131.0 to 140.0 nm which includes\nthe LBH band from N2 molecules. For each O/N2 plot, there is a plot of the\nSI image from which the O/N2 plot was generated, and there is an IDL saveset\nof the content of the O/N2 maps.  The Information URL of this descriptor\nidentifies detailed discussions of the derivations of O/N2 rations from the\nSI images.",

      "Caveats": "\n(1) O/N2 values are available only for dayside with solar zenith angle less than 90 degrees.\n(2) Auroral emissions are not removed. The O/N2 data in the auroral oval should not be used.\nThe original SI-13 images are also provided in the APL web site to identify auroral regions.\n(3) SI-13 flat field algorithm is provided by the IMAGE FUV team. But it may not work\nwell all the time. This impacts the O/N2 products.\n(4) Pointing of SI-13 is still subject to some errors even after attitude correction is done.\n(5) A fixed O/N2 value (assumed) for quiet times may ignore the effects of season and\nsolar EUV flux."
