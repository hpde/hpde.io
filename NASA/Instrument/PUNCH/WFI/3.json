        "Description": "Wide Field Imager (WFI) is a wide-field heliospheric imager (HI) design based on STEREO/HI. It images from 18 to 180 solar radii on the sky. HI designs are analogous to coronagraphs, but in linear instead of circular geometry. WFI attenuates direct sunlight by over 16 orders of magnitude. The wide-field achromatic optics are based on the famous Nagler eyepiece in reverse geometry. Polarization and detection use the same PFW and CCA designs as NFI. PUNCH includes three copies of WFI, to achieve the required observing cadence.",
