        "Description": "ELFIN will be flying two energetic particle detectors (EPDs). It has one EPD for ions (EPD-I) and one for electrons (EPD-E). The EPD-E is designed to handle energy in the ranges of 50keV to 4.5MeV.\r\n\r\n                      Both of these sensors are designed to have a field of view narrower than the loss cone. As a result, ELFIN will be the first mission to provide pitch-angle resolved, high-energy measurements of relativistic electron fluxes from within the loss cone. No other mission has taken this particular view of the radiation belts and this puts ELFIN in a position to deliver unique science to the community.",
