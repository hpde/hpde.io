        "Description": "The Advanced Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) is a high-optical throughput imaging system that \n\t\t quantifies gravity wave-induced temperature disturbances in the hydroxyl (OH) airglow layer. The instrument is \n\t\t designed to provide an outstanding combination of spatial and temporal resolution, field of view, and temperature \n\t\t precision. The AMTMâ€™s four identical telescopes will simultaneously measure the P1(2) and P1(4) emission lines of \n\t\t the OH (3,1) band, as well as the atmospheric background, from which the OH layer temperature will be derived.
