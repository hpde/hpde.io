        "Description": "The RHESSI X-ray-based flare list is obtained by comparing the observing summary count rate in the 6 to 12 keV energy band to a threshold. The count rate threshold is determined from the background level; which is obtained using a 60 second running average. For an interval to be considered as a flare candidate, the count rate must be greater than 3*sigma above the background level. Variations in the count rate due to changes in attenuator state or decimation state are taken into account by use of the \"corrected\" count rate method, which empirically determines the corrections.\nThe flare list is created during quicklook processing. The full list includes some events which are not necessarily of solar origin.\nThe complete description can be found at https://hesperia.gsfc.nasa.gov/rhessi3/docs/qlook/hsi_flare_list.html.",
