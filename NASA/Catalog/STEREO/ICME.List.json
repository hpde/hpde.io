For each of the 24 observations, the \r\nfollowing information is given: event start time, start time of the\r\n\"magnetic obstacle (~flux rope),\" event end time, maximum values of  \r\nthermal pressure, magnetic field magnitude and flow speed, a measure of \r\nspeed change over the event, a three-fold event characterization based\r\non the pressure profile, and a comment.  It is expected that this list, \r\ngiven in both PDF and Excel formats, will be updated periodically.",

In the hypothesis that all ICMEs have a central flux rope, these three groups of Pt profiles are due to different approach distances to the central flux rope. Group 1 ICMEs are assumed to be the ones penetrated by spacecraft near the flux rope axis, and they usually present signatures of magnetic clouds. See Jian et al. (2006) for more detail.",
