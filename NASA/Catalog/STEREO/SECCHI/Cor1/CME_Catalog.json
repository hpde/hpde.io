        "Description": "This catalog is a list of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by the COR1 instrument. COR1 is part of the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) mission, composed of twin spacecraft, the Behind-Earth and the Ahead-Earth spacecraft. It is the inner coronagraph of the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) suite and has a field of view (FOV) from 1.4 to 4 solar radii.\nThe catalog contains all CMEs manually identified since December 2006, which have width greater than 10 degrees, including faint events that are often missed by auto-detection methods. Events from STEREO-A and B are noted separately. \nThe catalog consists of a set of monthly tables.\nStarting from solar cycle (SC) 25, the catalog was updated by including COR2 and LASCO C2 movies and links to in-situ interplanetary CMEs (ICMEs), particle events and type II radio data. Note that, in 2014, contact with STEREO-B was lost after entering an uncontrolled spin preventing its solar panels from generating enough power. After that the catalog contains only STEREO-A events. In addition, there is data gap between 2014 and 2015 for STEREO-A due to its position almost directly behind the sun and it was transmitting only a weak signal or occasionally none. STEREO-A resumed its normal operation in November 2015.\nThe description of the parameters is given in accordance with the order in 2022.",
