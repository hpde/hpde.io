        "Description": "CME/ICME list created by Cho et al., 2003. Method:\r\n\r\nCMEs are selected which have temporal and spatial proximity to the type II events in Table 1 of Fry et al (2003). C2 appearance time, PA, and speed from SOHO/LASCO CME catalog are used (http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/CME_list/). They say: \"The procedure for examining the arrival time predictions of ICMEs and IP shocks for the near-simultaneous events are summarized as follows: \r\n\r\n(1) From the 173 type II events of Fry et al. [2003], we choose a total of 101 CMEs that are within a threshold window (~90 min). \r\n(2) We select 89 events from this group by comparing the position angles and the coordinate information of the associated flares. \r\n(3) We apply the adopted prediction models (the ensemble of shock propagation models and the empirical CME propagation models) to the selected events. Then we look for IP shocks that appear near the predicted times. For this, we examine the IP shocks identified by Fry et al. [2003] who used the NOAA/SEC 1-min resolution ACE and/or Wind plasma and field data, searching for simultaneous jumps in velocity, density, temperature, and total magnetic field magnitude according to the Rankine-Hugoniot relations. As a result, we identified 38 IP shocks. \r\n(4) We then search for ICMEs associated with the 38 IP shocks. For the identification of ICMEs, we look for MC and EJ from in situ magnetic field-plasma measurements and particle detection of ACE (available at http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/level2/index.html). According to Burlaga [1995] and Berdichevsky et al. [2002], a MC is defined as a large flux-rope structure of an almost cylindrical shape with low plasma beta (<0.6), enhanced magnetic field strength (>10 nT), and a large and smooth rotation of the magnetic field direction. In the case of EJs, which are not flux ropes and have disordered magnetic fields, smooth rotation may not be present. We also refer to previously identified sources of ICMEs [Gopalswamy et al., 2001; Cane and Richardson, 2003] and the Magnetic Cloud Table (available at http://lepmfi.gsfc.nasa.gov/mfi/mag_cloud_pub1p.html).\"",
