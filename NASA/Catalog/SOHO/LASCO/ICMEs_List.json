Some other SSCs have been identified using abrupt increases in the 1-minute SYM-H geomagnetic index. Otherwise, 'A' indicates the time of shock passage at ACE (e.g., in the ACE List of Disturbances and Transients or the Kasper/Stevens Shock list), 'W' indicates the time of a shock at the WIND spacecraft (from the Kasper/Stevens list or inspection of Wind plasma/field data), and 'S' indicates the time of a possible shock identified by the SOHO CELIAS/MTOF/PM \"Shockspotter\" program. If no shock or SC is reported or evident from these sources, the estimated arrival time of the disturbance (which in some cases is the ICME leading edge) is given to the nearest hour. Typical features we look for are increases in the solar wind speed, magnetic field strength and density that are more gradual than those associated with shocks.",

Note that more than one DONKI CME may have an estimated Earth arrival time that is consistent with the in situ observations. Generally, the CME time in DONKI has been adjusted to the time of the corresponding CME in the CDAW catalog, if this can be identified, for consistency with the pre-DONKI events. '?' indicates that the CME association may be doubtful. Times in brackets indicate solar events associated with the ICME during an interval with no coronagraph coverage. 'dg' indicates that there was a LASCO data gap around the expected time of the associated CME. Note that the absence of an associated CME, especially for more recent events, may indicate that this information has still to be compiled, and may be added later. A few associations were identified in collaboration with other members of the ISSI Working Team \"Understanding the Origins of Problem Geomagnetic Storms\".",
