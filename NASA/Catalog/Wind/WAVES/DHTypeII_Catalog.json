        "Description": "This is a catalog of decameter-hectometric (DH) type II bursts observed by the Radio and Plasma Wave (WAVES) experiment on board the Wind and STEREO spacecraft and the associated coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO, and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) missions. Part of this catalog is derived from the Wind/WAVES list available at https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/stereo/documents/websites/solar-radio/wind/data_products.html by adding a few missing events. From 2006, the catalog also contains data from STEREO WAVES. The CMEs in this catalog are called radio-loud CMEs because of their ability to produce type II radio bursts. The CME sources are also listed, as derived from the Solar Geophysical Data listing or from inner coronal images such as Yohkoh/SXT, SOHO/EIT, STEREO/EUVI, and SDO/AIA. Some solar sources have also been obtained from Solarsoft Latest Events Archive after October 1, 2002: http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/latest_events_archive.html. Information on the associated X-ray flares and solar energetic particle (SEP) events are from NOAA/GOES.",
