        "Description": "The ICMEs are identified based by inspection of a combination of signatures: a stronger than ambient magnetic field, relatively quiet and smooth magnetic field rotations, a low proton temperature, a higher density ratio of alpha particles to protons, an enhancement of total perpendicular pressure (Pt), a declining solar wind speed, etc. At least three of the above features are required to identify an ICME, with careful consideration of ambient solar wind. The boundaries of ICMEs are identified from a consensus of available features, usually delimited by sharp changes in plasma and magnetic field properties. For ambiguous events, we have checked the SOHO LASCO CME catalog and STEREO SECCHI observations. When there is a clear magnetic\nobstacle (flux rope) in an ICME, we give the start time of the magnetic obstacle as well. \nIn order to survey the ICMEs as completely as possible, the ACE data has been used when the Wind data were unavailable or noisy and when Wind was near or within the magnetosphere.\n1. Jian et al (Solar Physics, 239, 393-436, doi: 10.1007/s11207-006-0132-2, 2006) gives more details about the identification criteria and also the ICME list of 1995 – 2004.\n2. The ICME list of 1995 – 2006 is an appendix of Lan Jian's 2008 PhD thesis from UCLA. \n3. Jian et al. (Solar Physics, 274, 321-344, doi: 10.1007/s11207-011-9737-2, 2011) updates the results to 2009.\n4. The solar cycle variation from 1995 to 2011 is published in Jian et al. (Amer. Inst. Phys. Proceedings of Solar Wind 13, 1539, 195-198, doi: 10.1063/1.4811021, 2013), where STEREO A/B is used for 1-AU observation beyond 2009.",
