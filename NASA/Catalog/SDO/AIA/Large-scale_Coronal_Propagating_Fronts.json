        "Description": "The catalog is build on the observations (movies) of global disturbances in the solar corona with characteristic\npropagating fronts as intensity enhancement, Large-scale Coronal Propagating Fronts (LCPFs), as captured in AIA (SDO) and EUVI (STEREO-B, STEREO-A) images. They are often but not always associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). \nLCPFs are  similar to the phenomena that have often been referred to as Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) waves or extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) waves. Between 2010 April and 2013 January, a total of 171 LCPFs have been identified through visual inspection of AIA images in the 193 Å channel. \nThe list of movies can be found here: https://www.lmsal.com/nitta/movies/AIA_Waves/\nThe images used in these movies are shrunk to 768x768. They are 144s cadence for AIA, typically 5m cadence for EUVI. See http://www.lmsal.com/nitta/movies/AIA_Waves/oindex.html for movies that include all AEC-off AIA images. Their cadence is 12s (24s) before (after) October 10, 2010.\nPublication DOI 10.1088/0004-637X/776/1/58",
