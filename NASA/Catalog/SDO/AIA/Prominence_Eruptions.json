        "Description": "Prominence eruptions (PEs) are routinely imaged by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in the 304 Å pass band since May 2010. Using an algorithm developed as part of an LWS project, we have been detecting PEs 304 Å synoptic images with 2-min cadence. The 304 Å images were polar-transformed and divided by a background map (pixels with minimum intensity during one day) to get the ratio maps above the limb. The prominence regions were defined as pixels with a ratio >2. Two prominence regions with more than 50% overlapped pixels were considered the same prominence. If the height of a prominence increased monotonically in 5 successive images, it was considered eruptive. All the PEs seen above the limb were detected by the routine, but only PEs with width ≥15° are included in the list to eliminate polar jets and other small-scale mass motions. The identifications were also cross-checked with the PEs identified in Nobeyama Radioheliograph images ( http://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norh/html/prominence/). The following is the list of PEs automatically detected and checked for their reality. The list gives the date and time of the prominence eruption, its central position angle (CPA), the latitude of eruption (LAT) and the width (WD) of the eruptive prominence in degrees. Under \"Movie\", links are provided to Javascript movies that combine SDO/AIA images with GOES data (AIA304+GXRAY) and with SOHO/LASCO C2 images (+LASCO).\nRelated Publications:\n\nGopalswamy, N., Yashiro, S., Akiyama, S.
