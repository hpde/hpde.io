        "Description": "MIGHTI samples the O2 A band spectral region at five different wavelengths in order to both measure the shape of the band and to specify a background radiance that is subtracted from the signal. The wavelengths of the filter passbands are selected to maximize the sensitivity to lower thermospheric temperature variations. The temperature measurement is accomplished by a multichannel photometric measurement of the spectral shape of the molecular oxygen A-band around 762 nm wavelength. For each field of view, the signals of the two oxygen lines and the A-band are detected on different regions of a single, cooled, frame transfer charge coupled device (CCD) detector. Two filter channels sample either end of the band to define a background (754.1 nm and 780.1 nm) and three more sample its shape (760.0 nm, 762.8 nm and 765.2 nm). Using three filters that sample the band shape allows the simultaneous retrieval of the atmospheric temperature and common shifts in the center wavelengths of the pass bands due to thermal drifts of the filters. On-board calibration sources are used to periodically quantify thermal drifts, simultaneously with observing the atmosphere.",

The measurement is made at 5 spectral channels. 3 channels measure the A band and 2 others on either side of the band measure a background, which is subtracted from the 3 signal channels. An entire altitude profile is observed simultaneously. An onion-peeling inversion is used on the raw observations to remove the effects of the integration along the line of sight. See Stevens et al. (Space Science Reviews (2018) 214:4. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11214-017-0434-9). O2 A band spectra are  pre-calculated from 100-400 K in 20 K increments based on the HITRAN 2016 database [Gordon et al., JQSRT (2017), 203:3-69.https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jqsrt.06.038]  and smoothed filter functions with FWHM of ~2.0 nm. The filter functions are based on Gaussian fits to laboratory measurements and are a function of channel,  row (altitude), and column. The fits are separately done for each pixel as a function of peak wavenumber (wavelength), width, and transmittance. For each of the  three signal channels the fitted Gaussians are co-added over 51 pixels where the transmittance is largest for a representative filter function for that channel.  The transmittances are not absolutely calibrated in photometric units, but the relative transmittance between channels and between detectors is maintained,  which allows for the retrieval of temperature at the tangent altitude.",
