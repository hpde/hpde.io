Ion Differential Flux Intensities and Pressures sorted by Pitch Angle. This Data Set contains Van Allen Probe B Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment, RBSPICE, Level 3 Data, Time of Flight × Energy (TOF×E) Ion Flux Intensities and Pressures that are sorted by Pitch Angles. The Data include Unidirectional Differential Ion Fluxes (FIDU) that are measured at High-Energy Resolution, Low-Time Resolution by 6 Telescopes in 64 Channels from ~0.02 MeV to 1.0 MeV. The Data are listed by Telescope in Sector Order. Also available are Percentage Error of Measurement, Quality Flag for the each Measurement Pitch Angle Bin and Time Step, calculated Perpendicular and Parallel Partial Pressure, Number Density calculated by integrating the Distribution Function and Pitch Angle, Total Flux Intensity observed during the Spin by intergrating over Energy and Pitch Angle, and Omnidirectional Total Flux Intensity per Spin. In addition, the Data Set contains Orbit Number, Spacecraft Position of the Spacecraft in GEO, SM, and GSM Coordinates, current Sector Number where each Spin is divided into 36 Sectors, Duration of the Accumulation, current Spin Number of the Spacecraft, Orbit Number, Dipole L Values in different Reference Frames. Level 3 Data include all Level 2 Data plus Spacecraft Positions, Pitch Angles of the six Telescopes based upon the measured Magnetic Field received from the Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science, EMFISIS, Instrument. This Processing is done in a Series of algorithmic Steps in which the EMFISIS Magnetic Field Data are loaded, the Energetic Particle, Composition and Thermal Plasma Suite, ECT, Magnetic Ephemeris Data are loaded, the Level 2 Flux Intensity Data File is copied, and the Pitch Angles are calculated and placed. Finally, the calculated Pitch Angles are written out along with the Level 2 Data Parameters to create the Level 3 RBSPICE Data Files.",
