The actual Accumulation Intervals contributing to an Average consist of an Integral Number of Telemetry Subcomm Sequences, and correspond to all Subcomm Sequences which start in the nominal 10 min reporting Interval. The minimum Time corresponding to one Subcomm Sequence is 256 s at 1024 bps, the most Common Science Telemetry Rate. Thus the actual Start Time of the Accumulation may be up to 256 s later than the Start Time of the Nominal Interval. Similarly, the End Time of the Accumulation may extend up to 256 s beyond the End of the Nominal Interval. These Data are therefore not useful for highly accurate Timing Studies."

          "Description": "Nominal 10-minute average HET counting rate normally responding primarily to protons between 34 and 92 MeV in spin sectors 1-8. The rate has 8 elements, each corresponding to a 45° range of the spacecraft spin plane. The start of sector 1 (0°) is coincident with the spacecraft-generated Sun-pulse, and the start of each subsequent sector is shifted by 45° with respect to the preceding sector. For example, H45S1 covers the azimuthal range 0° to 45°, H45S2 covers the azimuthal range 45° to 90°, etc. In each sector, counts are registered only when the Axis of the Telescope view cone is within that sector. Rate channel H45S is a coincidence counting rate requiring coincident signals in detectors at least as deep in the stack as K1 (D7), and no signals from detectors deeper in the stack than K6 (D12). Data from multiple spacecraft spins contribute to the counting rates recorded for each sector, and the total accumulation time for the set of H45S1-H45S8 rates is required to be an integral number of spacecraft spins. Therefore the total accumulation time in each of the 8 sectors is 1/8 of the total time interval for the average.",
          "Caveats": "Since counts are registered based only on energy loss exceeding a certain threshold, there may in addition from time to time be significant contamination from high fluxes of high energy electrons. Nuclei with Z>1 with equivalent penetrating power to the protons in the nominal energy range are also counted, but rarely make significant contributions to the rate. The timing of the accumulation intervals is not commensurate with the nominal 10 minute grid. Counting rates reported here have a minimum time resolution of one telemetry subcomm sequence (256 s at 1024 bps, the most common science telemetry rate). The actual start time of the accumulation may therefore be up to 255 s later than the start time of the nominal interval. Similarly, the end time of the accumulation may extend up to 255 s beyond the end of the nominal interval.",

The start of sector 1 (0°) is coincident with the spacecraft-generated Sun-pulse, and the start of each subsequent sector is shifted by 45° with respect to the preceding sector. For example, H45S1 covers the azimuthal range 0° to 45°, H45S2 covers the azimuthal range 45° to 90°, etc. In each sector, counts are registered only when the Axis of the Telescope view cone is within that sector. Counting rate H7S requires coincident but small signals in D1 and D2, as well as energy losses in detectors at least as deep in the stack as K1 (D7), with no losses registered in K4 (D10) or detectors deeper in the stack. Electrons are identified by requiring low energy losses, consistent with a minimum ionizing particle, in the front detectors, D1 and D2, of the HET, and, at the same time, a limited range in the detector stack. The counting rate logic thus strongly discriminates against contamination from nuclei of any charge. Data from multiple spacecraft spins contribute to the counting rates recorded for each sector, and the total accumulation time for the set of H7S1-H7S8 rates is required to be an integral number of spacecraft spins. Therefore the total accumulation time in each of the 8 sectors is 1/8 of the total time interval for the average.",
