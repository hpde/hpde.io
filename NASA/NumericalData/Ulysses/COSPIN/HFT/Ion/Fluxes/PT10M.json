            "Description": "Parent Directory containing downloadable .zip compressed Yearly Subdirectories with Naming Convention coshftYY.zip, where YY indicates the two digit Year corresponding to the Data in the Subdirectory. Each Subdirectory contains Daily ASCII Files with Naming Convention ucoshftaYYDDD.dat where YY and DOY are the two digit Year and the three digit Day of Year (January 1 = 1). Each File contains nominally 10 min Averages of HFT Counting Rate based Fluxes of Protons and Heavier Nuclei from the COSPIN High Flux Telescope. The Data are presented in Flux Units, (cm^2 s sr MeV/n)^-1. Of the 22 Data Channels presented, 21 provide Spin-Averaged Fluxes, and one Proton Channel is accumulated in 32 Spin Sectors. Therefore each Tab-delimited Data Record contains, in addition to five Integer Time Fields, 53 Floating Point Fields of measured Fluxes. Since Particle Identification is based simply on Energy Losses exceeding Discriminator Thresholds in a single 18 micron thick Silicon Solid State Detector, explicit Identification of Nuclear Charge is not possible. The Channels are labeled with the usually dominant Particle Species, and may contain significant Contributions from Heavier Nuclei. The Contents of the 58 Fields in each Data Record are described in the COSPIN/HFT User Notes referred to above. (See also Anglin et al., J. Geophys. Res., 102, 1, 1997 for a further Discussion of the Function of the HFT, especially in High Flux Environments). The Thinness of the Detector in Combination with the Discriminator Threshold Levels make the HFT very insensitive to Electrons. The Data Cycle is Complex (See Simpson et al., 1992, cited above) and at the most Common Science Telemetry Rate of 1024 bps, one complete Data Cycle is returned every 256 s. Thus at low Bit Rates (256 bps or lower) a full Data Cycle cannot be completed in one 10 min Interval. Fortunately, prior to Loss of the Ulysses X-band Transmitter in January 2008 Periods where such low Bit Rates were used were quite rare. The Accumulation Intervals for all Fluxes, both Spin-Averaged and sectored, are synchronized with the Spacecraft Spin Period so that each Readout corresponds to an Integral Number of Spins."

          "Description": "Nominal 10-minute average HFT spin-averaged fluxes based on counting rate F2s, which split directionality of the F2 fluxes using 32 spin sectors. The counting rate responds primarily to protons in the energy ranges 0.29-6.7 MeV or 0.55-1.95 MeV, depending on whether the F2 threshold is set low or high respectively. The state of the F2 threshold is low if column 23 contains fill, and high if column 22 contains fill. See Anglin et al., J. Geophys. Res., 102, 1, 1997 for more detailed discussion of using the HFT F2S sectored rate.",
          "Caveats": "Since the energy range is defined entirely by a discriminator level on the single 18 micron thick Silicon detector, other high energy nuclei with energy losses in the detector greater than that of a normally incident 0.29 or 0.55 MeV proton (depending on the state of the F2 discriminator) will also contribute to these fluxes. Since the total accumulation time in each sector is less than 20 s in the nominal 10 minute averaging period, statistical accuracy of these sectored fluxes in a single averaging interval is usually poor except in large flux enhancements, most commonly produced by large solar energetic particle events, but also by the high radiation levels in the magnetosphere of Jupiter.",
