        "Description": "This PDS-accessible data set contains Cassini magnetic\nfield data at the highest resolution available as of May, 2012.  The MAG \ninstrument consists of the fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) and helium \nmagnetometer that is sometimes operated in vector mode (VHM) and sometimes \nin scalar mode (SHM).  The data for any time may be from any one of these \n(a flag indicates which), althought seems to be mostly from FGM.  Time \nresolution is variable from time to time, ranging at least from 4 vectors/min\nto 32 vectors/sec.  Nominally, FGM transmits 32 vectors/sec, and VHM and\nSHM 2 and 1 vectors/sec, at normal downlink data rate.  Magnetic field\nCartesian components are given mostly in RTN coordinates for the Cassini\ncruise phase (1999-08-16 to 2004-05-14) and in Kronographic coordinates \nat Saturn (>= 2004-05-14).  Spacecraft trajectory data are not included\nin the data records.  These data are expected to be superseded by\nVersion 3 data to be based on an improved calibration.",
