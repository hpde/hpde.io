        "Description": "The Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Subsystem (PWS) electric field waveform data set contains all available uncalibrated full resolution 4-bit measurements for the entire mission. The PWS waveform receiver samples the voltage on the 10 m electric antennas at the rate of 28800 samples per second through a 40 Hz to 12 kHz bandpass filter, utilizing an automatic gain control. However, gain information is not returned in telemetry so absolute calibration cannot be done directly. The waveform may be used to identify features such as dust impacts in the time domain or a power spectrum may be derived to show relative amplitudes of spectral elements in the frequency domain.",
