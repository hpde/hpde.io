 		"description": "\n Voyager 2 Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) Highband receiver daily files\n during Jupiter Encounter (1979-06-01 to 1979-07-30). Associated with these binary data are a series of quick-look GIF spectrogram plots created using the binary data. The plots are available for both polarization channels. These binary data were also converted into IDL save sets.\n\n\n The data set provides 48 second resolution highband radio mean power data\n in units of millibels. The high-band receiver consisted of 128 channels of\n 200 kHz bandwidth each, with center frequencies spaced at 307.2 kHz\n intervals from 1.2 MHz to 40.4 MHz. The highband receiver was designed\n especially for the observation of Jovian decametric radio emissions. The\n PRA radiometer was usually operated routinely in the so-called POLLO sweeping\n mode, in which all 198 frequency channels of the high- and low-band receivers\n together were swept in 6 sec, dwelling at each channel for 25 msec. From one\n step to the next in the channel switching sequence, the antenna polarization\n sense was reversed, i.e., was changed from RH to LH or vice versa. Thus the\n time required for making a measurement of both the RH and LH intensity\n components at both senses of elliptical polarization at a given frequency was\n 12 sec. The data consists of successive averages of 4 pairs of RH and LH\n intensity measurements, each average spanning an interval of 48 sec.\n\n The format of these binary data files is as follows:\n\n file separation variable\n\n year, month, day information\n\n millisecond decimal value of the day\n\n Integer array (128,2) for 128 left and right channels (NOTE 128 channels for Hi-band; 70 channels for Lo-band)\n\n file separation variable\n\n There is an IDL program that reads these files into an IDL-format save set.
