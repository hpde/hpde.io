        "Description": "* Data Set Overview\n* =================\n\n* Description of the PDS LECP Uranus Scan Data\n* ============================================\n\nThis Encounter Data Set consists of Resampled Electron and Ion Data from the Low Energy Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on Voyager 2 while the Spacecraft was within the Vicinity of Uranus.\n\nThe Period covered is 1986-01-24T00:00:00.000 SCET to 1986-01-27T00:00:00.000 SCET.\n\nThese Data include Scan Plane Angle Distributions for those Periods when the LECP Instrument was mechanically scanning. There are Periods when the Instrument was not scanning, and the corresponding Data do not appear here with these Step Data.\n\nThese Data approximate a Time Series of Charged Particle Fluxes from a Selection of Channels available from the Instrument. The word \"approximate\" is used because the Angle Scanning Modes of the Instrument complicates the Nature of the Data. At times the Instrument mechanically scans and at times it is fixed to look at a specific Direction. With the Type of Data given here, the Fluxes are angle averaged for those Time Periods when the Instrument is scanning, and are time averaged over an arbitrary Period (24 s) for the Periods when the Detectors are stationary. The angle averaged Records represent Periods of Time equal to 96 s or 384 s (see below). This kind of Data Presentation has been called the LECP Scan Data. Another Form that is also available is the LECP Step Data that gives the Angle Distributions sampled during the Scanning Periods.\n\nTwo Scanning Situations occurred during the Time these Data we collected. They are:\n\n* 1) Continuous 48 s Stepping (48 s for each of eight Look Directions for a Total of 6.4 min per Scan. Note that Sector 8 is covered by a 2 mm Aluminium Shield)\n* 2) A special Uranus Scan Cyclic with the following Sequence: 7, Scan, Scan, 7, Scan, Scan, Repeat, where the \"7\" represents a 10.4 min Period during which the Instrument is fixed in Sector 7 and where the word \"Scan\" represents a Period of Scanning (6 s Stepping for a total Scan Time of 48 s)\n\nFor these Uranus Scan Data, the two adjacent Scans within the Uranus Scan Cyclic (Mode 2 above) have been averaged together into a single 96 s Record. The Records of the 48 s Stepping Mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 min.\n\nAs stated in the first Paragraph, the Records for the Periods without Stepping during the Uranus Scan Cyclic (Mode 2 above) are for 24 s Periods.\n\nThe Schedule of Stepping Mode Changes is as follows:\n\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n| Time Interval                        | Mode Setting |\n-------------------------------------------------------\n| Prior to Day 24/0420 SCET            | Mode (1)     |\n| Day 24/0420 SCET to Day 25/1357 SCET | Mode (2)     |\n| After Day 25/1357 SCET               | Mode (1)     |\n+-----------------------------------------------------+\n\nPlease note that the change over between Modes is not instantaneous, and that for a few Minutes the State of the Scanning is not regular. Note also that there were brief Interruptions to, and Changes in Time Phase in the Mode (2) Scan Cyclic during the Transitions into and out of the movable Block Period that bracketed the Close Approach Position (not shown above).\n\nObviously these Stepping Mode Changes, and the Angle Sample Switching that occurs during Stepping Mode (2), gives the Data a disjointed Appearance.\n\nThe LECP Channels utilized with this Data Set are:\n\n+-----------------------------------------+\n| Channel   | Particle | Energy Range     |\n-------------------------------------------\n| EB01      | Electron | 22 to 35 keV     |\n| EB02      | Electron | 35 to 61 keV     |\n| EB03      | Electron | 61 to 112 keV    |\n| EB04      | Electron | 112 to 183 keV   |\n| EG06-EG07 | Electron | 252 to 480 keV   |\n| EG07-EG08 | Electron | 480 to 853 keV   |\n| EG08-EG09 | Electron | 853 to 1200 keV  |\n| PL01      | Ion      | 28 to 43 keV     |\n| PL02      | Ion      | 43 to 80 keV     |\n| PL03      | Ion      | 80 to 137 keV    |\n| PL04      | Ion      | 137 to 215 keV   |\n| PL05      | Ion      | 215 to 540 keV   |\n| PL06      | Ion      | 540 to 990 keV   |\n| PL07      | Ion      | 990 to 2140 keV  |\n| PL08      | Ion      | 2140 to 3500 keV |\n+-----------------------------------------+\n\nPlease note that three of the Electron Channels are derived from four of the Instrumental Channels by taking differences between adjacent Energy Channels.\n\nThe Channel Data is given in Units of Intensity: counts/(cm^2 s sr keV). For the Ions, it has been assumed that they consist only of Protons. Intensity is derived from the Raw Count Rates via the Relation:\n\nI=CR/(eGÃ—E2-E1))\n\nwhere eG is equal to the Geometric Factor times the Detector Efficiency, and (E2-E1) is the Bandpass of the Channel in Units of Energy. The Proton Values of these Parameters were used in deriving the Intensities for this Data Set. To obtain the Intensities under the Assumption that some other Mass Species dominates, one must convert back to Count Rate, CR, utilizing the Proton Parameters, and then convert to Intensity using the Parameters corresponding to the Mass Species in question. The Parameters can be found in Table 1 of Krimigis et al. (J. Geophys. Res., 86, 8227, 1981). The corresponding Parameters for Electrons can be found in Mauk et al. (J. Geophys. Res., 92, 15,283, 1987). Prior to the Conversion to Intensity, the Count Rates have been corrected for:\n\n* 1) Background\n* 2) Electron Contamination of the lower Energy Ion Channels\n* 3) Solar UV Contamination of the lowest Energy Ion Channel\n\nThe Uncertainty Parameters given with the Data associated with each Channel (expressed as a Percentage) is the Largest of the two Quantities:\n\n* 1) One Standard Deviation Poisson Statistical Error\n* 2) A Percentage assigned by the Data Supplier based on the Amount of Contamination Correction that has been performed on each Data Channel\n\nEach Record of this Data Set also includes a Parameter that denotes the Fraction of the Data Accumulations that correspond to each of the eight Angle Sectors. For example, during a Sector 7 Stow Period, this Number will be equal to one for Sector 7 and will be zero for all of the other Sectors. A \"Sector 9\" Parameter has also been defined that corresponds to those Accumulations with no known Sector Assignment.\n\nAlso, a 1-Bit Code is supplied for each Data Channel that tells whether that Channel had any associated Accumulations (1 denotes At least one Accumulation present, 0 denotes No associated Accumulations). This Code must be used to distinguish between Accumulations that yielded no Counts and Situations where the Channel simply had no Accumulations since both of these Scenarios yield Zero Intensity Data.\n\n+----------------------------------------+\n| Parameter Characteristics | Value      |\n------------------------------------------\n| Processing Level ID       | 4          |\n| Software Flag             | Y          |\n| Processing Start Time     | 1991-07-24 |\n| Processing Stop Time      | 1991-07-25 |\n+----------------------------------------+",
