        "Description": "As of this writing (11/5/2010), this product \nhad been issued by the IBEX team in two releases. \nRelease 1 IBEX-Hi map data are superseded by Release 2\ndata which are more time-extensive (12 months vs. 6 months)\nand are richer in content.  While Release 1 IBEX-Hi map data \nand their documentation remain accessible at\nftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/ibex/hi/maps/digital_data/release_1/\nand\nftp://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/ibex/hi/maps/images/release_1/,\nthis description supports the retrieval and use of Release 2 data only.\n\nThe Release_2 IBEX-Hi map data contain all-sky 6 deg x 6 deg \nresolution maps in J2000 ecliptic coordinates of energetic \nneutral fluxes reaching the near-Earth IBEX spacecraft from \nthe distant heliosphere and heliosheath.  Maps \nare in both a spacecraft frame and, via Compton-Getting \ncorrections, a heliospheric frame.  Basic maps are each \naccumulated over 6-months duration, so far for epochs 1 \n(12/2008-06/2009) and 2 (06/2009-12/2009).  Maps are available \nfor five of the energy bands of IBEX-Hi (0.52-0.95, 0.84-1.55, \n1.36-2.50, 1.99-3.75, 3.13-6.00 keV) and, for the heliospheric \nframe only, also for six monoenergetic points (0.71, 1.11, 1.74, \n2.73, 3.0, 4.29 keV).  In addition, monoenergetic maps are available\nas summed over the data collected during epochs 1 and 2 combined.\nAll maps are available in digital text format and in PNG image format\n(considered as separate data sets within VEPO).\n\nGiven that VHO/VEPO typically displays clickable granule (file)\nnames for any given specification of data product and time span,\nand given that IBEX-Hi digital maps and PNG-formatted display\nmaps are each considered single data products, a request for data\nfrom either product will yield .GE.20 names of files containing data\nspanning or within the requested time span.  For IBEX, the names\nshown by VHO/VEPO actually have the form subdirectory/filename.\nThe subdirectories are named map1, map1cg, map2, map2cg, and\nmap-combined.  Maps involving \"1\" (\"2\") are from the first (second)\n6-month epoch, while \"combined\" means composed of data taken\nduring epochs 1 and 2.  Maps involving (not involving) \"cg\" means\nheliospheric frame (spacecraft frame).  In the first four subdirectories,\nfile names are of the forms ha60.hide-trp-flux100-hi-N-flux.ext and\nha60.hide-trp-mono_80-P.PP-flux.ext, where \"ext\" is \"png\" or \"txt\"\naccording to which product is requested,  N is the energy step\nnumber for the IBEX-Hi instrument (2-6), P.PP is the energy level,\nin keV, of a monoenergetic flux.  Files in the \"combined\"\nsubdirectories are named \"combined-P.PP-flux.ext, where P.PP\nhas the same meaning as above.\n\nIn addition to the flux maps to which VEPO provides access, \nseveral map files whose data support the determination of the \nfluxes are also available in the underlying nssdcftp directories \nand are described by aareadme files there (and by IBEX web pages \nat SWRI: http://ibex.swri.edu/ibexpublicdata/Data_Release_2/)",
