        "ReleaseDate": "2021-03-11T18:39:11Z",
        "Description": "This 15-min-resolution data set consists of 5 count rates from the Low Energy Telescope, \n        8 count rates for the main telescope (MT), 4 counts of pulse height analyzed events in each of 4 MT \n        coincidence modes, and 27 box counts corresponding to specific species and energy ranges associated \n        with 3 of the MT coincidence modes.  Actually the 13 referenced \"count rates\" are given as paired counts\n       and accumulation times.  Associated documentation suggests algorithms for computation of count rates and\n       fluxes from the MT data given, for electrons in 3 energy bands (0.7-2.0, 2.0-12, 12-50 MeV), protons in 9 bands\n       (11.24-20.00 MeV to 74.50-94.78 MeV), helium nuclei in 10 bands  (10.90-12.89 MeV per n to 84.32-94.81 MeV per n),\n       and CNO nuclei in 1 band (25 - 250 Mev per n). There are no azimuthally sectored data in this data set.  \n       The data are accessible via ftp and, with higher functionality, via FTPBrowser.",
