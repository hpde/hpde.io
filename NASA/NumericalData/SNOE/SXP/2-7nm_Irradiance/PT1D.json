        "Description": "This data set was provided by the PI team and contains daily values of the integrated solar X-ray irradiance (2-7 nm) as measured by the SNOE Solar X-ray Photometer. The data cover the time period March 11, 1998 to October 1, 2000 and are given in ASCII format. Irradiances are given as measured at the spacecraft and adjusted to 1 A.U. Also included are the 10.7 cm solar radio flux (daily and 81-day average) measured at Ottawa, Canada and Lyman Alpha photon fluxes measured by the UARS SOLSTICE instrument. ",
