 		"description": "The joint California Institute of Technology, Caltech, Goddard Space Flight Center, GSFC, Cosmic Ray Subsystem, CRS, experiment on Voyager consists of three types of solid state detector telescopes: * Two High Energy Telescopes: HET-I and HET-II * Four Low Energy Telscopes (dE/dx versus E): LET A, LET B, LET C, and LET D * The Electron Telescope, TET The HETs and LETs are redundant and are designed to complement each other and to cover a broad range in energy, intensity, and charge spectra. The HETs covered an energy range between 6 MeV/n and 500 MeV/n for nuclei ranging in atomic numbers from 1 through 30. In addition, electrons in the energy range between 3 MeV and 100 MeV were measured by this telescope and an electron telescope. The LETs measured the energy and determined the identity of nuclei for energies between 0.15 MeV/n and 30 MeV/n and atomic numbers from 1 to 30. The instruments also measured the anisotropies of electrons and nuclei. The CRS looks only for very energetic particles in plasma, and has the highest sensitivity of the three particle detectors. Very energetic particles can often be found in the intense radiation fields surrounding some planets (like Jupiter). Particles with the highest-known energies come from other stars. The CRS looks for both. The CRS makes no attempt to slow or capture the super-energetic particles. They simply pass completely through the CRS. However, in passing through, the particles leave signs that they were there. Cosmic Ray Subsystem Science Objectives: * To measure the energy spectrum of electrons from 3 Mev to 110 MeV. * To measure the energy spectra and elemental composition of all cosmic ray nuclei from hydrogen through iron over an energy range from approximately 1 - 500MeV/nuc. * To provide information on the energy content, origin, acceleration process, life history, and dynamics of cosmic rays in the galaxy, and contribute to an understanding of the nucleosynthesis of elements in cosmic ray sources. * To provide information on the transport of cosmic rays, Jovian electrons, and low energy interplanetary particles over an extended region of interplanetary space. * To measure the three-dimensional streaming patterns of nuclei from Hydrogen through Iron and electrons over an extended range. * To measure particle charge compostion in the magnetosphere of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.",
