 		"description": "This magnetic field data set contains 9.6 second averages that are created from 1.92 second averages. It includes the Voyager spacecraft number (1 or 2), the date-time in\ndecimal year (90.00000 is day 1 of 1990), the magnetic field strength F1\ncomputed from high-resolution magnitudes, the elevation and azimuth angles\n(degrees) in heliographic (RTN) coordinates, and the magnetic field strength F2\ncomputed from hour averages of the components. The vector components of B can be\ncomputed from F2 and the two angles. Elevation angle is the latitude angle above\nor below the solar equatorial plane, and azimuth angle is in the direction\norbital motion around the Sun from the projection of the Sun-to-spacecraft axis\ninto the solar equatorial plane. The Voyager MAG experiment and coordinates are\nfurther described in the following publication:  Behannon, K.W., M.H. Acuna,\nL.F. Burlaga, R.P. Lepping, N.F. Ness, and F.M.

The spacecraft magnetic field at the\noutboard magnetic field sensor, referred to as the primary unit, was expected to\nbe 0.2 nT and highly variable, consistent with current estimates.

The use of roll calibrations lasting about 6\nhours permits determination of the effective zero levels for the two independent\nmagnetic axes that are perpendicular to the roll axis (which is nearly parallel\nto the radius vector to the Sun) at intervals of about 3 months. There is no\nroll calibration for the third magnetic axis.

COORDINATE SYSTEMS:  Interplanetary magnetic field studies make use of two<br>
important coordinate systems, the Inertial Heliographic (IHG) coordinate system<br>
and the Heliographic (HG) coordinate system.<br>
The IHG coordinate system is use to define the spacecraft's position.  The IHG<br>
system is defined with its origin at the Sun.  There are three orthogonal axes,<br>
X(IHG), Y(IHG), and Z(IHG).  The Z(IHG) axis points northward along the Sun's<br>
spin axis.  The X(IHG) - Y(IHG) plane lays in the solar equatorial plane.  The<br>
intersection of the solar equatorial plane with the ecliptic plane defines a<br>
line, the longitude of the ascending node, which is taken to be the X(IHG) axis.<br>
The X(IHG) axis drifts slowly with time, approximately one degree per 72 years.<br>
Magnetic field orientation is defined in relation to the spacecraft.  Drawing a<br>
line from the Sun's center (IHG origin) to the spacecraft defines the X axis of<br>
the HG coordinate system.  The HG coordinate system is defined with its origin<br>
centered at the spacecraft.  Three orthogonal axes are defined, X(HG), Y(HG),<br>
and Z(HG).  The X(HG) axis points radially away from the Sun and the Y(HG) axis<br>
is parallel to the solar equatorial plane and therefore parallel to the<br>
X(IHG)-Y(IHG) plane too.  The Z(HG) axis is chosen to complete the orthonormal<br>
triad.<br>
An excellent reference guide with diagrams explaining the IHG and HG systems may<br>

computed from high-resolution magnitudes, the elevation and azimuth angles<br>
(degrees) in heliographic (RTN) coordinates, and the magnetic field strength F2<br>
computed from hour averages of the components. The vector components of B can be<br>
computed from F2 and the two angles. Elevation angle is the latitude angle above<br>
or below the solar equatorial plane, and azimuth angle is in the direction<br>
orbital motion around the Sun from the projection of the Sun-to-spacecraft axis<br>
into the solar equatorial plane. The Voyager MAG experiment and coordinates are<br>
further described in the following publication:  Behannon, K.W., M.H. Acuna,<br>

Experiment for Voyager-1 and Voyager-2, Space Science Reviews, 21 (3), 235-257,<br>
1977...At the time of experiment proposal, it was expected that the required<br>
accuracy of the measurements would be 0.1 nT, determined by the combined noise<br>
of the sensors and the spacecraft field. The spacecraft magnetic field at the<br>
outboard magnetic field sensor, referred to as the primary unit, was expected to<br>
be 0.2 nT and highly variable, consistent with current estimates. Hence, the<br>
dual magnetometer design (Ness et al., 1971, 1973; Behannon et al. 1977). ..At<br>
distances &gt; 40 AU, the heliospheric magnetic fields are generally much weaker<br>
than 0.4 nT; the average magnetic field strength near 40 AU and 85 AU is about<br>
0.15 nT and 0.05 nT, respectively. The use of roll calibrations lasting about 6<br>
hours permits determination of the effective zero levels for the two independent<br>
magnetic axes that are perpendicular to the roll axis (which is nearly parallel<br>
to the radius vector to the Sun) at intervals of about 3 months. There is no<br>
roll calibration for the third magnetic axis. Comparison of the two derived<br>
magnetic vectors from the two magnetometers permits validation of the primary<br>
magnetometer data with an accuracy of 0.02 to 0.05 nT. A discussion of the<br>
uncertainties that must be considered when using these data is given in the<br>
Appendix of Burlaga et al. [1994] and in Appendix A of Burlaga et al. [2002].<br>

COORDINATE SYSTEMS:  Interplanetary magnetic field studies make use of two<br>
important coordinate systems, the Inertial Heliographic (IHG) coordinate system<br>
and the Heliographic (HG) coordinate system.<br>
The IHG coordinate system is use to define the spacecraft's position.  The IHG<br>
system is defined with its origin at the Sun.  There are three orthogonal axes,<br>
X(IHG), Y(IHG), and Z(IHG).  The Z(IHG) axis points northward along the Sun's<br>
spin axis.  The X(IHG) - Y(IHG) plane lays in the solar equatorial plane.  The<br>
intersection of the solar equatorial plane with the ecliptic plane defines a<br>
line, the longitude of the ascending node, which is taken to be the X(IHG) axis.<br>
The X(IHG) axis drifts slowly with time, approximately one degree per 72 years.<br>
Magnetic field orientation is defined in relation to the spacecraft.  Drawing a<br>
line from the Sun's center (IHG origin) to the spacecraft defines the X axis of<br>
the HG coordinate system.  The HG coordinate system is defined with its origin<br>
centered at the spacecraft.  Three orthogonal axes are defined, X(HG), Y(HG),<br>
and Z(HG).  The X(HG) axis points radially away from the Sun and the Y(HG) axis<br>
is parallel to the solar equatorial plane and therefore parallel to the<br>
X(IHG)-Y(IHG) plane too.  The Z(HG) axis is chosen to complete the orthonormal<br>
triad.<br>
An excellent reference guide with diagrams explaining the IHG and HG systems may<br>
be found in Space and Science Reviews, Volume 39 (1984), pages 255-316, MHD<br>
