      <Description>
	This instrument, SUMER (Solar Ultraviolet Measurement of
	Emitted Radiation) is a high resolution far UV spectrometer
	working in the 50--160 nm range. Its goals are to make
	measurements with 1 arcsec angular resolution, a spectral
	resolving power (lambda/Delta-lambda) of 30,000, and a time
	resolution better than 10 s. The spectrometer is ab le to
	build images at several wavelengths and to record spectra of
	any structure on the solar surface or nearby the sola r
	limb. SUMER is capable of selecting small structures to
	determine local plasma parameters (temperature, density, veloc
	ity, etc.), to improve our knowledge in coronal heating
	mechanisms and solar wind generation processes. The instrument
	i s composed of: a one mirror telescope; a set of slits at the
	focus, adjustable in flight; a spectrometer (using a spheri
	cal concave grating) fed through the selected slit; and a
	detector. The detector is located on the grating normal. The d
	etector is a 2-D MAMA (Multi-Anode Multichannel Array) with
	1024 pixels (25 micrometers) along the dispersion and 360 pi
	xels along the slit length image. Along the dispersion the
	pixels are coated with two photocathodes of different efficie
	ncy: half with MgF2, half with KBr. An attenuator is used for
	H I Lyman alpha. Instrument operations will make optimum u se
	of the SOHO capability for 9.3 hours continuous contact and
	two 1.3 hour contacts during each 24 hour day. The EIT in
	strument on the same spacecraft will provide near real time
	images that can be used to refine the operations of the SUME R
	in real time. This information is from the paper ``SUMER:
	Temperatures, Densities, and Velocities in the Outer Solar A
	tmosphere,'' by P. Lemaire et al. (Proceedings of the First
	SOHO Workshop, ESA SP-348, pp. 13-16, November 1992).
