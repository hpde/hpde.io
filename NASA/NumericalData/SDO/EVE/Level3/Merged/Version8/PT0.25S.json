        "Description": "EVE level 3 data files were created at the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics in Boulder, Colorado for the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE). The Science Processing and Operations Center (SPOC) is responsible for creating and maintaining access to all EVE products. For a high-level introduction to the EVE instrumentation please visit:\nhttps://lasp.colorado.edu/home/eve/science/instrument/\n\nLevel 3 products are defined to contain daily averages beginning on 2010, day 120, April 30. This version change includes updated long-term degradation corrections for MEGS-B and ESP. A small dark adjustment was applied to MEG-B and large degradation changes were applied based on SDO EVE sounding rocket measurements. The MEGS-P (Lyman-alpha) diode processing has been updated to replace the Kalman filter with a Fourier transform filter, and the calibration has been updated to match SORCE SOLSTICE version 17.\n\nThe mission length merged datasets are provided at three sampling sizes for user convenience; specifically, native level 2 sampling (0.02nm), 1 angstrom, and 1 nm. The optical resolution is about 0.1 nm, so the 0.02nm spectra contain 5 samples per resolution element.",
