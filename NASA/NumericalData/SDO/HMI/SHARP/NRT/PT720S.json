        "Description": "SHARP Near Real Time data in CCD coordinates.\n\nSHARP stands for Space-weather HMI Active Region Patch. A SHARP is a DRMS series that contains (1) various space-weather quantities calculated from the photospheric vector magnetogram data and stored as FITS header keywords, and (2) 31 data segments (described in detail below), including each component of the vector magnetic field, the line-of-sight magnetic field, continuum intensity, doppler velocity, error maps and bitmaps. The data segments are not full-disk; rather, they are partial-disk, automatically-identified active region patches. SHARPs are calculated every 12 minutes. Often, there is more than one active region on the solar disk at any given time. Thus, SHARPs are indexed by two prime keys: time, T_REC, and HMI Active Region Patch Number, HARPNUM.\n\nNote that HARPNUMs in the nrt and defnitive data series will be different.",
