The TIDE team has provided Web Sites that allow Users to process Data from the Web and then download the processed Data Files and Plots, see the Custom Plot and Data Dump Links on one of the TIDE Home Pages. The Software (C and IDL) can be downloaded and installed locally. There is a Data Download Page that can be used to get the Level-Zero Data and the required Ancillary Data (Polar Orbit and Attitude, extracted EFI Spacecraft Potential, and Ion Masks). NOTE: The only Way to read a TIDE Level-Zero File is with the Processing Software. See the TIDE Documentation Link on one of the two TIDE Home Pages for Documentation of the Processing Software and the Input File Data Formats. See the Parameters below for more Information about Key Elements in the Level-Zero Processing.",

      "Caveats": "TIDE was originally designed to detect mass-resolved ions, H+, O+, He+, and NO+, for 32 energy steps (31 reported), 32 spin angle bins, and 7 polar angle channels. The detection of time-of-flight direct-events deteriorated rapidly early in the mission, reducing the ability to resolve ion masses and resulting in the lost of information in one axis (Z). After 09/30/96, the ion data is of poor quality and as a result, only Total Ions (Stops) are reported starting 12/08/96. Total Ions is the sum over the 7 polar angle channels of the particle counts detected by the Stop microchannel plate (MCP) detectors. The resolution in the 32 energy steps and in the 32 spin angle bins is retained. 1996 H+, O+, and He+ data are reported in the TIDE H0 CDFs. In order to avoid damage to the MCPs, starting 03/27/96 and continuing throughout the rest of the mission, the high voltage on the MCPs is reduced during radiation belt passes.",

For science mode 2 (contingency), the minor frames are 43 bytes long. The first three bytes contain TIDE housekeeping bytes or fill data (000). The remaining bytes contain TIDE science data products (see Science Data Products Parameter) or fill data.

All of the Data Products for a specific spin are reported as a spin packet that contains a spin header followed by each Data Product. Six Data Products contain instrument parameters or memory dumps. The remaining 182 Data Products contain collapsed and doubly compressed ion counts for specific ions, energy bins, and spin and polar angle bins. The counts can be summed (collapesd) over adjacent energy and spin angle bins. The counts are then converted (compressed) from a 16-bit to an 8-bit integer. A Lossy compression is then applied to the Data Product bytes. The data products reported each spin depend on TIDE's operating modes.

          "Description": "The TIDE instrument recorded high counts centered on two different spin angles and resulting from solar photons. There is one large pulse (centered on the sun direction) and one small pulse (at high spin angles) every spin of the spacecraft, about every 6 s. The ion mask is used to subtract the sun pulse and background noise. Once every other day at a point near apogee where few counts are expected the MCPs are shut down for a couple of superspins (32 spins/superspin) so that only background counts and sun pulses are detected. The count rate data collected during this time are then averaged to get the background mask. The mask file is a binary file that contains an averaged background count for each energy (31), spin angle (32), polar angle (7), and mass (6). From 04/01/96 to 12/07/06, the mask files contain a mask for each of the ions (H+, He+, O+, He++, molecular ions, and Singles). For Total Ions (Stops) data from 12/08/96 to 04/15/08, the mask file is mostly zeros with masks created for H+ (never used) and for Stops. The Stops mask is a 31 x 32 (energy versus spin angle) array stored in channel 3 (polar angle), mass 4. For Stops the rest of the array is zeros.",
