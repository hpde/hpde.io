 		"description": "These data sets consist of co-aligned, high-resolution, simultaneous observations taken with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) and the Hinode satellite. The data provides science-ready images and spectra of solar features in the photosphere (the surface of the sun), chromosphere (lower atmospheric layers), and the transition region (the layer between the chromosphere and corona).\n\nRIRIS records spectra in the near-ultraviolet band (NUV) from 278.3 nm to 283.4 nm and in the far-ultraviolet bands from 133.2 nm to 135.8 nm (FUV 1) and 138.9 nm to 140.7 nm (FUV 2). The spectra are obtained every 0.5 s to 60 s along a slit (1/3\" wide). IRIS detects solar material at temperatures from 5,000 K to 10 million K. IRIS slit-jaw images (SJI) are taken every 0.5 s to 60 s using filters centered at Mg II k 279.6 nm (SJI 2796), the far Mg II h wing at 283.2 nm (SJI 2832), C II at 133 nm (SJI 1330), and Si IV at 140 nm (SJI 1400). In this way, IRIS provides images of solar features as small as 240 km (150 miles) and allows inference of how much material is present at specific velocities, temperatures and densities. These data can then be used to probe the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the transition region and thus to study energetic and dynamic properties of material throughout the solar atmosphere.\n\nThe Hinode satellite carries three instruments: the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS), the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) and the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT). The XRT and EIS instruments are dedicated to transient eruptive phenomena and the dynamics of the transition region and corona. SOT is focused on emergence and evolution of magnetic structures in the solar photosphere and chromosphere. The datasets we provide here are based on data from the Spectro Polarimeter (SP), the Narrowband Filter Imager (NFI), and the Broadband Filter Imager (BFI), all part of SOT. SOT provides measurements of the full vector magnetic field on spatial scales of 150-200 km (93-124 miles) with a high polarimetric accuracy. The SP is a spectrograph recording polarization spectra in the Fe I 630.2 nm doublet. It provides observations of all four Stokes parameters at high spatial resolution (0.16\" pixel size) and spectral sampling (21.55 mÅ). The NFI instrument was employing selectable bandpass to perform full Stokes polarimetric imaging that allowed intensity maps, longitudinal and transverse magnetograms, and Dopplergrams to be calculated. The spatial resolution of the NFI is about 0.08\" per pixel in the spectral range 517-657 nm. This wavelength range covers the photosphere and the lower chromosphere. The default spectral line for longitudinal magnetic and Doppler observations was Na I D1 589.6 nm. The BFI was recording diffraction-limited images over the wavelength range from 388.3 nm to 668.4 nm. It observed both photospheric and chromospheric layers (blue, green, and red continuum measurements plus Ca II H filtergrams). The BFI had a high spatial resolution (0.0541\"/pixel) and rapid cadence (less than 10 s) over a 218\" by 109\" field of view.\n\nIRIS and Hinode/SOT-SP/NFI/BFI images are co-aligned using their respective header information. For these co-aligned data cubes, the headers of the Hinode/SOT images are updated with results from cross-correlation between SOT Ca II H images with the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) 170.0 nm channel. The different duration of observational sequences, IRIS roll angles and solar rotation tracking are taken into account. Processed SOT observables are the BFI filtergrams (Ca II H 3968 Å, G band 4305 Å and CN band 3883 Å), the NFI LOS magnetograms along with Stokes I and V images, and SP level 2 data (maps of the intensity, magnetic field strength, transversal and longitudinal components of the magnetic field vector, inclination, azimuth, Doppler velocities, filling factor, and the total polarization). The co-aligned IRIS and Hinode/SOT data cubes can be examined using the IRIS SolarSoft routines as they are formatted in the same way as IRIS level 2 data. The IRIS observations are corrected for dark current, flat-field, geometric deformation, wavelength calibrations, background light leak in FUV, and they are scaled to the same plate-scale. The Hinode measurements are corrected for dark current, flat-field, bad pixels, and the pointing, roll-angle and plate-scale keywords in the FITS headers are properly updated.",

Spectra are obtained every 0.5 s to 60 s along a slit (1/3&quot; wide). It detects solar material at temperatures from 5,000 K to 10 million K. IRIS slit-jaw images (SJI) are taken every 0.5 s to 60 s using filters centered on Mg II k 279.6 nm (SJI 2796), the far Mg II h wing at 283.2 nm (SJI 2832), C II 133 nm (SJI 1330), and Si IV 140 nm (SJI 1400). In this way IRIS provides images of solar features as small as 240 km (150 miles), and allows inference of how much material is present at specific velocities, temperatures and densities.</p>

The XRT and EIS instruments are dedicated to transient eruptive phenomena and the dynamics of the transition region and corona. SOT is focused on emergence and evolution of magnetic structures in the solar photosphere and chromosphere. The datasets we provide here are based on data from the Spectro Polarimeter (SP), the Narrowband Filter Imager (NFI), and the Broadband Filter Imager (BFI), all part of SOT. SOT provides measurements of the full vector magnetic field on spatial scales of 150-200 km (93-124 miles) with a high polarimetric accuracy. The SP is a spectrograph recording polarization spectra in the Fe I 630.2 nm doublet. It provides observations of all four Stokes parameters at high spatial resolution (0.16&quot; pixel size) and spectral sampling (21.55 mÅ). The NFI instrument was employing selectable bandpass to perform full Stokes polarimetric imaging that allowed intensity maps, longitudinal and transverse magnetograms, and Dopplergrams to be calculated. The spatial resolution of the NFI is about 0.08&quot; per pixel in the spectral range 517-657 nm. This wavelength range covers the photosphere and the lower chromosphere. The default spectral line for longitudinal magnetic and Doppler observations was Na I D1 589.6 nm. The BFI was recording diffraction-limited images over the wavelength range from 388.3 nm to 668.4 nm. It observed both photospheric and chromospheric layers (blue, green, and red continuum measurements plus Ca II H filtergrams). The BFI had a high spatial resolution (0.0541&quot;/pixel) and rapid cadence (less than 10 s) over a 218&quot; by 109&quot; field of view.</p>
