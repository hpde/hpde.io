 		"description": "This data set contains observations taken with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) in coordination with the Swedish 1m Solar Telescope (SST) on La Palma, Spain. These observations are co-aligned, high-resolution observations of solar features at the surface of the sun (photosphere), in the lowermost layers of the solar atmosphere (chromosphere) and transition region (the layer just below the corona).\n\nRIRIS records spectra in the near-ultraviolet band (NUV) from 278.3 nm to 283.4 nm and in the far-ultraviolet bands from 133.2 nm to 135.8 nm (FUV 1) and 138.9 nm to 140.7 nm (FUV 2). The spectra are obtained every 0.5 s to 60 s along a slit (1/3\" wide). IRIS detects solar material at temperatures from 5,000 K to 10 million K. IRIS slit-jaw images (SJI) are taken every 0.5 s to 60 s using filters centered at Mg II k 279.6 nm (SJI 2796), the far Mg II h wing at 283.2 nm (SJI 2832), C II at 133 nm (SJI 1330), and Si IV at 140 nm (SJI 1400). In this way, IRIS provides images of solar features as small as 240 km (150 miles) and allows inference of how much material is present at specific velocities, temperatures and densities. These data can then be used to probe the photosphere, the chromosphere, and the transition region and thus to study energetic and dynamic properties of material throughout the solar atmosphere.\n\nThe SST is a vacuum refractor telescope capable of delivering diffraction-limited images of solar features of at least 75 km (47 miles) in size at 630 nm. With its two tunable filter instruments, the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP) and the CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer (CHROMIS), the SST provides monochromatic images of the solar photosphere and chromosphere in selected spectral lines, from 380 nm to 500 nm (CHROMIS) and from 500 nm to 860 nm (CRISP). The CRISP instrument provides spectropolarimetric data, measuring all four Stokes parameters, which gives information on the properties of the solar magnetic fields. CHROMIS simultaneously provides narrowband filtergrams (intensity images) at several wavelengths in the core of the Ca II K line.\n\nThe co-aligned IRIS and SST data sets contain a recast of the standard IRIS level 2 data and SST observations. They are 4-dimensional data cubes (x, y, wavelength, time). The spatial x and y axes are along the raster slit positions and the spectrograph slit, respectively. The third axis is the wavelength dimension and the fourth axis is time. The IRIS data is corrected for dark current, flat-field, geometric deformation, and scaled to the same plate-scale. The calibration pipeline includes wavelength calibrations and subtraction of the background light leak in FUV data. The SST observations are corrected for dark current, flat-field and are restored by means of the Multi-Object, Multi-Frame Blind deconvolution (MOMFBD). The data reduction pipeline for SST also includes polarimetric calibration, correction for residual seeing motions and destretching. The current database is made of 16 coordinated, fully processed, co-aligned IRIS and SST observations taken from September 2013 until September 2019. Those observations show the spatio-temporal evolution of the solar photospheric, chromospheric and the transition region features in the quiet Sun, coronal holes, enhanced network, active regions with and without sunspots, and plage regions.",

Spectra are obtained every 0.5 s to 60 s along a slit (1/3&quot; wide). It detects solar material at temperatures from 5,000 K to 10 million K. IRIS slit-jaw images (SJI) are taken every 0.5 s to 60 s using filters centered on Mg II k 279.6 nm (SJI 2796), the far Mg II h wing at 283.2 nm (SJI 2832), C II 133 nm (SJI 1330), and Si IV 140 nm (SJI 1400). In this way IRIS provides images of solar features as small as 240 km (150 miles), and allows inference of how much material is present at specific velocities, temperatures and densities.</p>

With its two tunable filter instruments, the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP) and the CHROMospheric Imaging Spectrometer (CHROMIS), the SST provides monochromatic images of the solar photosphere and chromosphere in selected spectral lines, from 380 nm to 500 nm (CHROMIS) and from 500 nm to 860 nm (CRISP). The CRISP instrument provides spectropolarimetric data, measuring all four Stokes parameters, which gives information on the properties of the solar magnetic fields. CHROMIS simultaneously provides narrowband filtergrams (intensity images) at several wavelengths in the core of the Ca II K line.</p>
