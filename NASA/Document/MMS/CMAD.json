        "Description": "The MMS Calibration and Measurement Algorithm Document (CMAD) serves three purposes:\r\n1.\tIt provides an ongoing record of the mission science operations plan and instrumentation status.\r\n2.\tIt describes the concept for calibrating the many instruments onboard Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), including pre- and in-flight calibrations, and details the algorithms for converting instrument signals to physical quantities, including signal estimates, error analyses, and error budgets. And,\r\n3.\tIt serves as a user guide for each instrument’s data products, documenting best practices for analysis and the advantages/limitations in application.",
