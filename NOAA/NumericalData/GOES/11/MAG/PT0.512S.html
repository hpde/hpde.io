 		"description": "GOES 11 magnetic field data at 0.512 s time resolution. The vector magnetic field is given in the spacecraft Earth-referenced coordinate system:  Hp, He, Hn, and Ht, where  Hp is perpendicular to the satellite orbital plane, or parallel to spin axis of the Earth in the case of a 0° inclination orbit, He is perpendicular to Hp and directed earthward, Hn is perpendicular to both Hp and He and directed eastward, and Ht is the total field.\n\nThis data product also provides GOES 11 satellite positions and velocities derived from SSCWEB GEI ephemeris, interpolated to 1 min time resolution.\n\nThe magnetometer data are downlinked from the spacecraft in real-time to the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) in Boulder, Colorado. The data from the raw Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) telemetry stream are processed by pre-processors at SWPC and from there 1 min averages are distributed to SWPC Space Weather Operations, as well a archived at the NOAA National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) and the NASA Coordinated Data Analysis Web (http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/). The raw high resolution data are corrected and processed at the NOAA SWPC, and later archived at NGDC.\n\nThe major issue for processing the high resolution data is correction for the magnetic signature of spacecraft torquer currents as briefly discussed in the magnetometer instrument descriptions. In normal operation, the magnetometer samples its three axes every 0.512 s, synchronized with the telemetry frames.  The magnetometer has an anti-aliasing low-pass filter on each axis.  As part of the attitude control on the spacecraft, there are two magnetic torquers.  At the magnetometers, these torquers can generate magnetic fields larger than the ambient fields to be measured.  Therefore signals from these torquer currents need to be removed. The torquer currents are measured at the same rate as the magnetometer rate, and the currents are used to correct the magnetometer measurements.\n\nHowever, the torquer currents were not low-pass filtered.  As a result, large instantaneous steps in the torquer currents show up in the magnetometer data as a delayed, slowly rising wave with some ringing, just what one would expect from the magnetometer low-pass filters. The so-called \"Farthing coefficients\" simulate, from a short past history of the torquer measurements, the effects of the magnetometer filters.  The torquer current changes are asynchronous with the telemetry frames and the timing between these events must be measured to a eighth of a telemetry frame interval for good performance. The transient responses in changes in torquer currents are reduced, but not eliminated for large changes in torquer currents.\n\nThere exists one opportunity at the beginning of each mission to perform a spacecraft rotation maneuver to determine magnetometer offsets. These offsets are used through the duration of the lifetime of each satellite.\n\nApproximate coefficients are:\n\n* 0.8 mA per torquer current count\n* 4 counts per torquer current command step (3.2 mA per command step)\n* 410 mA full scale current\n* 32 magnetometer counts per nT (approximate)\n* 8 torquer step counts can be up to approximately 0.5 nT (depends on axis, which torquer, which satellite, etc.)",

Also, note that there can be small jumps in the data (typically &lt;1 nT) when the torquer counts go through zero. The magnitude of the effect can be different for different spacecraft.

The GOES 8 to GOES 12 spacecraft are 3-axis stabilized and there is only one opportunity for a spin maneuver at the beginning of the mission to determine on-orbit offsets. There are additional complications that result from needing to know the changing offsets introduced by torquer coils on the satellites. Though comparisons of data to model fields during quiet times, we are doing rather well with the offsets, but it is not possible to give an exact number for the accuracy. We continue to look at comparisons of data and models, and data to other nearby spacecraft encounters. We are interested in anything learned by the user, or working with the user to help interpret the data, or to answer questions. While we have put in a significant effort to remove the effects of torquer coil interference, in the 0.512 s data there can be small, typically less than 1 nT spikes in the data at the time of torquer current changes. More information on this topic is included the more extensive "readme file".
