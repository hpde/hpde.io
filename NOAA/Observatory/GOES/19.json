        "Description": "The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites-U (GOES-U) satellite is designed to provide critical weather, climate and solar data to meteorologists and other parties to enhance the safety of people and property.\n\nThe GOES-R Series is a four Satellite Program, GOES-R/S/T/U, that will extend the Availability of the operational GOES Satellite System through 2036. The NOAA GOES-R Series of Satellites is designed to improve the Forecasts of Weather, Ocean, and Environment by providing faster and more detailed Data, real-time Images of Lightning, and advanced Monitoring of Solar Activities and Space Weather. GOES 19 can collect three Times more Data at four times Image Resolution, and scan the Planet five times faster than previous Probes.",
