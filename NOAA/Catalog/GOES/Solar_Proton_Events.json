        "Description": "Flares are characterized by a rise time of the order of minutes and a decay of the order of tens of minutes. The total energy released in a typical flare is about 1027 J; the magnetic field is extraordinarily intense, reaching values of 10-2 to 1 Tesla. This list is constructed by NGDC from the basic reports sent monthly from the ground-based observatories. The National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) holds archives for about 80 stations, covering the period 1938 to the present. Currently 5 stations send their data to NGDC Boulder on a routine monthly basis. Optical flares in H-alpha are usually accompanied by radio and X-ray bursts, and occasionally by high-energy particle emissions.",

SESC defines the start of a proton event to be the first of 3 consecutive data points with fluxes greater than or equal to 10 pfu. The end of an event is the last time the flux was greater than or equal to 10 pfu. This definition, motivated by SESC customer needs, allows multiple proton flares and/or interplanetary shock proton increases to occur within one SESC proton event. Additional data may be necessary to more completely resolve any individual proton event.",
