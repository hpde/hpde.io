        "Description": "The European Space Agency, ESA, Solar Orbiter mission will study the Sun from a highly elliptical orbit getting as close as 0.28 AU or 42 million km from which it will use a suite of instruments to make high-latitude observations of the Sun and heliosphere, including the magnetic field, energetic particles, solar wind, and transient phenomena.\n\nThe Solar Orbiter primary science objectives are to study:\n\n* 1) the drivers of the solar wind and the origin of the coronal magnetic field to determine how solar transients drive heliospheric variability\n* 2) learn how solar eruptions produce the energetic particles that fill the heliosphere\n* 3) how the solar dynamo works and drives connections between the Sun and the heliosphere\n\nSolar Orbiter comprises a 2.5 m ⨯ 3.0 m ⨯ 2.5 m box-shaped bus with two solar panel wings spanning 18 m to supply power. Total launch mass is 1800 kg. There is a 4.4 m instrument boom and three 6.5 m antennas protruding from the spacecraft body. A carbon fiber composite, titanium layered solar shield covers one side of the spacecraft. The shield has apertures for various instruments. The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized to keep the heat shield oriented towards the Sun. Telemetry is dual X-band through steerable medium and high-gain antennas. Low gain antennas are used in the launch and early orbit phase and are available for backup.\n\nSolar Orbiter carries two types of instruments, in-situ instruments making direct measurements of the heliospheric environment, and remote sensing instruments, which view the Sun and heliosphere from a distance.\n\nThe in-situ instruments comprise: \n\n* 1) Energetic Particle Detector, EPD\n* 2) Magnetometer, MAG\n* 3) Radio and Plasma Waves sensor, RPW\n* 4) Solar Wind Plasma Analyser, SWA\n\nThe remote-sensing instruments comprise: \n\n* 1) Extreme Ultraviolet Imager, EUI\n* 2) Coronagraph, METIS\n* 3) Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager, PHI\n* 4) Heliospheric Imager, SoloHI\n* 5) Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment, SPICE\n* 6) X-ray Spectrometer/Telescope, STIX\n\nThe total massm of the scientific payload is 209 kg.\n\nSolar Orbiter launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on 10 February 2020 at 04:03 UT or at 23:03 Eastern Standard Time, EST, on February 9th. The spacecraft launched on an Atlas 5-411 (AV-087) into a short Earth parking orbit followed by injection into an elliptical heliocentric orbit. The first perihelion will be in June 2020. The mission will use six gravity assist maneuvers during the 7-year nominal mission: \n\n+---------------------------------+\n| Flyby | Planet | Encounter Date |\n|---------------------------------|\n|   1   | Venus  |   2020-12-26   |\n|   2   | Venus  |   2021-08-08   |\n|   3   | Earth  |   2021-11-26   |\n|   4   | Venus  |   2022-09-03   |\n|   5   | Venus  |   2025-02-18   |\n|   6   | Venus  |   2026-12-28   |\n+---------------------------------+\n\nThe series of encounters will tilt the spacecraft orbit to an inclination of 25° and will yield an orbit with a perihelion of 0.28 AU, an aphelion of 0.91 AU, and a period of 168 days. Solar Orbiter will make fourteen perihelion passes during the nominal mission. If a three year extended mission is approved, Solar Orbiter will make three more Venus flybys that will bring the inclination to 33°.\n\n+---------------------------------+\n| Flyby | Planet | Encounter Date |\n|---------------------------------|\n|   7   | Venus  |   2028-03-17   |\n|   8   | Venus  |   2029-06-10   |\n|   9   | Venus  |   2030-09-02   |\n+---------------------------------+\n\nThe extended mission will involve an additional eight more perihelion passes.",
