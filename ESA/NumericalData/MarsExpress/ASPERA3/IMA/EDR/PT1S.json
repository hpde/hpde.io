        "Description": "The data consist of arrays of counts of ions at 96 energy steps\nspanning 0.01-40 keV/q and 32 mass channels giving good coverage for H+, He+, He++, O+.\nTemporal separation between arrays is ~12 sec (in the arrays sampled).\nThe data are organized in csv ASCII format for spreadsheet usage.  No spacecraft\ntrajectory data are included in these experiment data records, but see\nhttps://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=PSA&page=ancillary.  As of June 2012, these data were available for mid-2003 through Jun 2011, although for the 2003 cruise phase, a total of only several hours of data were generated and are available.",
