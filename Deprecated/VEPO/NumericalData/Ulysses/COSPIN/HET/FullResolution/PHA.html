At the most common science telemetry rate, 2048 bps, \n        six events are collected in every 32 second telemetry format.  Because of the large\n        geometrical factor of the telescope, almost every available pha slot contains an\n        event.  Since far more events are recorded in the telescope than can be returned\n        as pha events in the telemetry, only a sample of the events incident on the telescope\n        can be sent down as pha events.  \n        With the pha data for an event, the particle's charge, mass, kinetic energy, and \n        trajectory through the telescope can be determined.  While most of the nuclei incident \n        on the HET are protons, a three-level priority system selects events for pulse-height\n        analyis and return in the telemetry so as to assure capture of almost all of the\n        relatively rare heavy element nuclei that stop in the telescope.  The lowest priority \n        (P3) events are those that satisfy the most basic criteria for being an analyzable event, \n        as determined by the combination of discriminators on various detectors in the telescope \n        that fire.  A higher priority (P2) is given to events that stop in the telescope, and the\n        highest priority (P1) is given to events that stop in the telescope and that are identified \n        as heavy  nuclei by the size of their energy deposits in the detectors.  \n        The highest priority event that occurs in each window for accumulation of pha events\n        is selected for inclusion in the telemetry data returned to the ground.  Thus, in large \n        solar energetic particle events with abundant heavy nuclei, few protons may be included \n        in the pha events transmitted via telemetry.  The counting rates, however, count every \n        event, and in such cases it can usually be assumed the counting rates that respond to \n        protons are dominated by the proton flux.\n        Absolute fluxes for individual elements may be derived by identifying pha events that \n        would contribute to counting rates (i.e. that have the same discriminator configuration as\n        one of the counting rates) and determining the ratio between events counted by the rate\n        and returned in telemetry during a given interval.  Appropriate counting rates exist \n        that match each of the three pha priority states.  The priority levels corresponding to the \n        counting rates are listed in Table 7 of Simpson et al.

The PHA data are complex, so a<br>
careful study of the material below and of the similar material in the header of<br>
each file is strongly recommended before trying to use these data.</p>
<pre><code>       The parameters listed are:

       Column 5 (discs):  
       12 character hexadecimal representation of the state of all discriminators on the
       12 pulse-height analyzed detectors, D1-D6 and K1-K6 (or D7-D12) in the HET. 
       D1 and D2 each have 4 discriminator levels, denoted L,M,H, and S for Low, Medium,
       High, and Switch (S controls the gain state of the detector amplifier).  
       D3 has 3 levels (L,M, and S), while D4 has only 2 levels (L and S). 
       D5, D6, and K1-K6 each have 3 levels (L,H, and S).
       As described in the in-line documentation in the header of each file, the states of 
       these discriminators are combined into one hexadecimal character for each detector.   

       Column 6 (ash):       
       3 character integer representation of the states of single level discriminators 
       (0=off, 1=on) on detectors A (detects particles which completely penetrate the 
       detector stack), S (scintillator which detects particles entering or exiting
       through the side of the stack), and H (logical sum of H-level discriminators on
       detectors D5-K6;  if set to 1, event is priority 1) 

       Column 7 (P123):
       3 character integer representation of the priority level of the event. The effective
       priority is that of the highest level triggered.  For example 1XX (X may be 0 or 1)
       corresponds to a priority 1 event, 01X to a priority 2 event, and 001 to a priority 3
       event.    

       Column 8 (C1245):
       4 character representationf of the state of commands 1,2,4, and 5 (See Simpson et al.,
       1992 for definitions of commands).  1=command in effect, 0=command off.  These 
       commands were never issued in flight, so the value should always be 0000.     

       Column 9 (sect):
   Spin sector in which the analyzed event occurred.  PHA sectors are identical to the
       sectors used for the sectored countint rates H45S and H7S.

       Column 10 (ifc):
       1 if IFC is in progress, 0 otherwise

       Column 11 (step):
       Most recent step executed in the 2048 step IFC sequence 
      
       Columns 12-17 (p1-p6):
       Channel numbers of the signals from the P-side of the position sensing detectors D1-D6.
       The amplifiers on the D and K detectors have two gain ranges.  If the discriminator S
       is triggered on any detector, the low gain range is used for that detector  and the 
       conversion of channel number to energy deposit must be interpreted accordingly.  
       If the S(witch) discriminator is not triggered, the high gain range is used.
       Contacts on the P-sides of the position sensing detectors consist of thin strips (223 for
       detectors D1-D3, and 144 for detectors D4-D6) distributed along a resistive divider
       chain.  Thus the signal collected from the P-side is proportional to the position of the
       strip closest to the particle penetration along the divider chain.  See Lamport et al. (Nuc.
       Inst. Meth., vol. 134, p.71, 1976) for a more detailed description of the function of the
       position sensing detectors.    

       Columns 18-23 (e1-e6):
       Channel numbers of the signals from the E-side of the position sensing detectors D1-D6.
       Again, if the S(sitch) discriminator is triggered for a detector, the channel number corresponds
       to the output of the low gain amplifier for that detector..  
       Contacts on the E-sides of the position sensing detectors are single evaporated contacts
       covering the entire surface of the detector.  Thus the full signal is collected from the 
       E-side.  The P/E ratio then determines the position of the particle penetration in 1 dimension
       perpendicular to the orientation of the strips on the P-side.
       The single S discriminators on the D1-D6 detectors mean that the P and E signals from each 
       detector are always produced using the same gain range.

       Columns 24-29 (k1-k6):

       Channel numbers of the signals from the 0.5 cm thick Kevex detectors that form the calorimeter
       portion of the HET.  Again, the amplifier on these detectors  are dual range.  If the S discriminator
       is fired, the signal size and thus the channel corresponds to the low gain range of the amplifier.

       Columns 30-35 (p1ST-p6ST):
       Strip numbers (X1000) corresponding to the P/E ratios from detectors D1-D6.

       Columns 36-41 (e1EN-e6EN): 
       Energy deposits (MeV*1000) based on the E-signals from detectors D1-D6. 
       Channel to energy conversions are regularly updated based on results of
       In-Flight Calibrate sequences performed approximately monthly. 

       Columns 42-47 (K1EN-K6EN):
       Energy deposits (MeV*1000) based on PHA channels from detectors K1-K6.
       Channel to energy conversions are similarly updated based on IFC sequences
       performed roughly once per month.. 

       Column 48 (RANGE):
       Detector number of the deepest detector in the stack with a signal above
       the low-level (L) discriminator.  Values range from 1-13, where D1-D6 = 1-6,
       K1-K6 = 7-12, and A=13.

       Columns 49-50 (X0, Y0):
       X, Y position (mm X 1000) of the particle trajectory in a plane half way 
       between detectors D3 and D4.
       Computed from positions determined in D1-D6.

       Column 51 (angle):
       Angle of the trajectory with respect to the HET axis (degrees X 1000).
       Computed from positions determined in D1-D6. 

       Columns 52-53 (RMS1, RMS2):
       Root mean square deviations from the best fit trajectory in D1-D3 and D4-D6.
       Computed from positions determined in D1-D6.

       Columns 54-55  (DX, DY):
       DX and DY are projections of the trajectory onto the X- and
       Y-axes where the projection onto the Z-axis is 1.  Thus, the
       tangent of the angle is sqrt(Dx * Dx + Dy * Dy) and the secant is
       sqrt(1 + Dx * Dx + Dy * Dy).

       Columns 56-57 (RS, RSP1)
       Radius from the telescope axis in the stopping detector as defined by Range above (RS) 
       and in the next detector beyond the stopping detector (RSP1), measured in mm X1000.

       Column 58 (ZCAL):
       Estimate of particle charge (Zx1000) based on energy losses and trajectory in the 
       telescope, derived using the ZCAL algorithm developed by K.H. Lau (Cal Tech Ph.D. 
       Thesis, 1985).

</div><div class="term">Caveats</div><div class="definition">
          Occasional logically inconsistent combinations of status and flag bits (discriminator triggers, 
          status bits, etc.) occur.  For example, firing of the H discriminator but not the L for a 
          detector, or low (or higher) level discriminators fired for K1 and K3 but not K2. 
          These are probably the result of a timing glitch or pile-up of more than
          one event within the resolving time of the logic.  For such events, and for events of 
          questionable quality for any other reason, no nuclear charge will be computed.

          The ZCAL algorithm as implemented does not work well for Hydrogen, and often does not
          work at all for electrons.  Hydrogen will generally be assigned a ZCAL near 0.7 (700
          as listed in this file).  Electrons will either be given a fill (-1) value or some
          small value.  To study protons and electrons using PHA data, it is recommended that
          all events with ZCAL &gt; 1.3 be eliminated, and that the remaining events be analyzed using
          standard dE/dX vs. residual energy techniques, using the detector immediately in front
          of the stopping detector to measure dE/dX, and the stopping detector (indicated by 
          Range in Column 49) to measure residual energy.

          For protons and electrons, the trajectory determining system (P and E signals) does
          not give accurate trajectories as a result of the small energy deposits left in the
          position sensing detectors.
