High time resolution calibrated waveform data sampled in one \nof 3 frequency bands in the range 0-577 kHz along one axis using either an \nelectric field antenna or a magnetic search coil sensor. The dataset also \nincludes instrument mode, data quality and the angles required to orient the \nmeasurement with respect to the magnetic field and to the GSE coordinate \nsystem. \n\nThe AC electric field data are obtained by using one of the two 88m \nspin plane electric field antennas of the EFW (Electric Fields and Waves) \ninstrument as a sensor. The AC magnetic field data are obtained by using \none of the two search coil magnetometers (one in the spin plane, the other \nalong the spin axis) of the STAFF (Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field \nFluctuations) instrument as a sensor. The WBD data are obtained in one of \nthree filter bandwidth modes: (1) 9.5 kHz, (2) 19 kHz, or (3) 77 kHz. The \nminimum frequency of each of these three frequency bands can be shifted \nup (converted) from the default 0 kHz base frequency by 125.454, 250.908 \nor 501.816 kHz. The time resolution of the data shown in the plots is \ndetermined from the WBD instrument mode. The highest time resolution \ndata (generally the 77 kHz bandwidth mode) are sampled at 4.6 \nmicroseconds in the time domain (~4.7 milliseconds in the frequency \ndomain using a standard 1024 point FFT). The lowest time resolution data \n(generally the 9.5 kHz bandwidth mode) are sampled at 36.5 microseconds \nin the time domain (~37.3 milliseconds in the frequency domain using a \nstandard 1024 point FFT). The availability of these files depends on times of \nPanska Ves ground station telemetry downlinks. A list of the status \nof the WBD instrument on each spacecraft, the telemetry time spans, \noperating modes and other details are available under Science Data \nAvailability on the University of Iowa Cluster WBD web site at http://www-\npw.physics.uiowa.edu/cluster/ and through the documentation section of \nthe Cluster Science Archive (CSA) (https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/csa/documentation).

In order to convert the WBD data to the frequency \ndomain via an FFT, the following steps need to be carried out: 1) If Electric \nField, first divide calibrated data values by 1000 to get V/m; 2) Apply \nwindow of preference, if any (such as Hann, etc.); 3) Divide data values by \nsqrt(2) to get back to the rms domain; 4) perform FFT (see Bandwidth \nvariable notes for non-continuous modes and/or the WBD User Guide \narchived at the CSA); 5) divide by the noise bandwidth, which is equal to \nthe sampling frequency divided by the FFT size (see table below for \nappropriate sampling frequency); 6) multiply by the appropriate constant \nfor the window used, if any. These steps are more fully explained in the \nWBD Calibration Report archived at the CSA.... \n\nBURST MODE: ...\nWBD data can also be obtained in a mode called Burst Mode 2 (BM2), stored onboard, \nand transmitted to the ground with the data from all the other instruments. \nThis mode has been rarely used throughout the mission only once prior to July 2010 (on March 7, 2001), \nbut more often thereafter to obtain data at low altitude or in the high priority auroral acceleration region, \nbecause it results in decreased bandwidth or a higher degree of duty cycling for WBD. \n\nNASA's Deep Space Network terminated WBD data acquisition in February 2015 and after that date \nWBD operations are limited to Panska Ves real time downlink (limited to altitudes below 10 RE) \nand a limited number of BM2 operations. This resulted in a decreased total weekly quota of WBD operations, \nespecially at higher altitudes where only BM2 mode is available.\nBM2 data are thus obtained primarily at outer boundaries (bow shock,\nforeshock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, plasmasheet) and during\nperigee crossings of the magnetic equator when Panska Ves does not\nhave visibility.

three filter bandwidth modes: (1) 9.5 kHz, (2) 19 kHz, or (3) 77 kHz. The<br>
minimum frequency of each of these three frequency bands can be shifted<br>
up (converted) from the default 0 kHz base frequency by 125.454, 250.908<br>
or 501.816 kHz. The time resolution of the data shown in the plots is<br>
determined from the WBD instrument mode. The highest time resolution<br>
data (generally the 77 kHz bandwidth mode) are sampled at 4.6<br>
microseconds in the time domain (~4.7 milliseconds in the frequency<br>
domain using a standard 1024 point FFT). The lowest time resolution data<br>
(generally the 9.5 kHz bandwidth mode) are sampled at 36.5 microseconds<br>

<p>CONVERSION TO FREQUENCY DOMAIN: ... In order to convert the WBD data to the frequency<br>
domain via an FFT, the following steps need to be carried out: 1) If Electric<br>
Field, first divide calibrated data values by 1000 to get V/m; 2) Apply<br>
window of preference, if any (such as Hann, etc.); 3) Divide data values by<br>
sqrt(2) to get back to the rms domain; 4) perform FFT (see Bandwidth<br>
variable notes for non-continuous modes and/or the WBD User Guide<br>
archived at the CSA); 5) divide by the noise bandwidth, which is equal to<br>
the sampling frequency divided by the FFT size (see table below for<br>
appropriate sampling frequency); 6) multiply by the appropriate constant<br>
for the window used, if any. These steps are more fully explained in the<br>
WBD Calibration Report archived at the CSA....</p>
<p>BURST MODE: ...<br>
WBD data can also be obtained in a mode called Burst Mode 2 (BM2), stored onboard,<br>
and transmitted to the ground with the data from all the other instruments.<br>
This mode has been rarely used throughout the mission only once prior to July 2010 (on March 7, 2001),<br>
but more often thereafter to obtain data at low altitude or in the high priority auroral acceleration region,<br>
because it results in decreased bandwidth or a higher degree of duty cycling for WBD.</p>
<p>NASA's Deep Space Network terminated WBD data acquisition in February 2015 and after that date<br>
WBD operations are limited to Panska Ves real time downlink (limited to altitudes below 10 RE)<br>
and a limited number of BM2 operations. This resulted in a decreased total weekly quota of WBD operations,<br>
especially at higher altitudes where only BM2 mode is available.<br>
BM2 data are thus obtained primarily at outer boundaries (bow shock,<br>
foreshock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, plasmasheet) and during<br>
perigee crossings of the magnetic equator when Panska Ves does not<br>
have visibility.  Typically, approximately 4 operations of 1-2 hours duration<br>
are obtained in these regions each month.</p>

Wave Receivers on all four Cluster satellites, each satellite being uniquely identified<br>
by its number (1 through 4) or its given name (Rumba, Salsa, Samba, Tango,<br>
respectively).  High time resolution calibrated waveform data sampled in one<br>
of 3 frequency bands in the range 0-577 kHz along one axis using either an<br>
electric field antenna or a magnetic search coil sensor. The dataset also<br>
includes instrument mode, data quality and the angles required to orient the<br>
measurement with respect to the magnetic field and to the GSE coordinate<br>
system.</p>
<p>The AC electric field data are obtained by using one of the two 88m<br>
spin plane electric field antennas of the EFW (Electric Fields and Waves)<br>
instrument as a sensor. The AC magnetic field data are obtained by using<br>
one of the two search coil magnetometers (one in the spin plane, the other<br>
along the spin axis) of the STAFF (Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Field<br>
Fluctuations) instrument as a sensor. The WBD data are obtained in one of<br>
three filter bandwidth modes: (1) 9.5 kHz, (2) 19 kHz, or (3) 77 kHz. The<br>
minimum frequency of each of these three frequency bands can be shifted<br>
up (converted) from the default 0 kHz base frequency by 125.454, 250.908<br>
or 501.816 kHz. The time resolution of the data shown in the plots is<br>
determined from the WBD instrument mode. The highest time resolution<br>
data (generally the 77 kHz bandwidth mode) are sampled at 4.6<br>
microseconds in the time domain (~4.7 milliseconds in the frequency<br>
domain using a standard 1024 point FFT). The lowest time resolution data<br>
(generally the 9.5 kHz bandwidth mode) are sampled at 36.5 microseconds<br>
in the time domain (~37.3 milliseconds in the frequency domain using a<br>
standard 1024 point FFT). The availability of these files depends on times of<br>
Panska Ves ground station telemetry downlinks. A list of the status<br>
of the WBD instrument on each spacecraft, the telemetry time spans,<br>
operating modes and other details are available under Science Data<br>
Availability on the University of Iowa Cluster WBD web site at http://www-<br>

<p>CALIBRATION: ... The procedure used in computing the calibrated Electric<br>
Field and Magnetic Field values found in this file can be obtained from the<br>
Cluster WBD Calibration Report archived at the CSA website in the<br>
Documentation section. Because the calibration was applied in the time<br>
domain using simple equations the raw counts actually measured by the<br>
WBD instrument can be obtained by using these equations and solving for<br>
'Raw Counts', keeping in mind that this number is an Integer ranging from 0<br>
to 255. Since DC offset is a real number, the resultant when solving for raw<br>
counts will need to be converted to the nearest whole number.  A sample<br>
IDL routine for reverse calibrating to obtain 'Raw Counts' is provided in the<br>
WBD Calibration Report archived at the CSA. ...</p>
