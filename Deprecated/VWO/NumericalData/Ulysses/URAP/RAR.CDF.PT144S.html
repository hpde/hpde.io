<p>Notes on the Radio Astronomy Receiver<br>
from URAP User Notes<br>
http://helio.esa.int/ulysses/archive/urap_un.html</p>
<p>The Radio Astronomy Receiver is divided into two parts, a low<br>
frequency receiver and a high frequency receiver.  The low<br>
frequency receiver has 64 channels that cover the frequency range<br>
from 1.25 to 48.0 kHz in linear steps of 0.75 kHz.  The high<br>
frequency receiver has 12 channels that cover the range from 52<br>
kHz to 940 kHz in approximately logarithmic steps.</p>
<p>The high frequency receiver is usually operated in what is called<br>
&quot;measure&quot; mode, which causes the receiver to step repeatedly<br>
through a list of frequencies that is determined by a ROM on<br>
board the spacecraft.  There are 16 different lists and one of<br>
them is chosen by telecommand.  The different lists emphasize<br>
different frequency ranges, so as to maximize the information<br>
received depending on the type of phenomena being studied.  Some<br>
of the lists include all 12 possible frequency channels while<br>
other lists skip some of the frequencies.  The list that has been<br>
used for most of the mission does include all frequecies, but<br>
there may be times when other lists have been used.  At these<br>
times only a subset of the frequencies will be present.</p>
<p>The low frequency receiver can be operated in measure mode (with<br>
its own set of lists of 8 or 16 frequencies) or in &quot;linear sweep&quot;<br>
mode where it steps through a contiguous set of frequencies.  In<br>
linear mode, all 64 frequencies can be stepped through, or a<br>
subset of 32 frequencies can be chosen using the lower half,<br>
middle half, or upper half of the frequencies.  For most of the<br>
mission, the low frequency receiver has been operated in linear<br>
mode with all 64 frequencies but there have been periods when it<br>
has operated in measure mode or in in linear mode with less than<br>
64 frequencies.  During these periods only a subset (8, 16, or</p>
<ol start="32">
<li>of the 64 possible frequencies will appear.</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides the intensity of a signal reaching the spacecraft, the<br>
RAR can also, when operated in particular modes, determine<br>
additional information about the source of the radiation,<br>
including its direction relative to the location of Ulysses, its<br>
angular size, and its polarization.  This is most efficiently<br>
done with the signal from the X and Z axis antennas summed<br>
together electronically either with or without a phase shift<br>
added between the two signals.  Although this additional<br>
information cannot be recovered from the averaged data, the mode<br>
does have a large effect on the background signal level, so the<br>
mode of high and low frequency receivers is given in the data as<br>
either summed (X and Z antenna combined) or separate (X antenna<br>
alone).</p>
