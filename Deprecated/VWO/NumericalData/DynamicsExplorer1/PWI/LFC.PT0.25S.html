             each. The analog channels were centered at 1.78, 3.12, 5.62, 10.0, 17.8, 31.2,                        
             56.2 and 100 Hz.  Each channel's band-edge was at +/-15% of the center value.

into coplanar polar orbits with DE-1 in a highly elliptical orbit and DE-2<br>
in a lower more circular orbit. The primary objective of the DE program was<br>
to investigate magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere coupling processes.<br>
The DE mission provided a wealth of new information on a wide variety of magnetospheric<br>
plasma wave phenomena including auroral kilometric radiation, auroral hiss,<br>
Z mode radiation, narrow-band electromagnetic emissions associated with equatorial<br>
upper hybrid waves, whistler mode emissions, wave-particle interactions stimulated<br>
by ground VLF transmitters, equatorial ion cyclotron emissions, ion Bernstein<br>
mode emissions, and electric field turbulence along the auroral field lines.</p>
<pre><code>            These files contain calibrated, full resolution, data from the DE-1 Plasma Wave                         
             Instrument (PWI).  This instrument was designed and built by the plasma wave                          
             group at The University of Iowa, Department of Physics and Astronomy, in collaboration                
             with investigators at Stanford University's STAR Laboratory.  It measured plasma                      
             wave phenomena and quasi-static electric fields using paired combinations of                          
             five PWI sensors: a 200m tip-to-tip long wire electric antenna deployed in the spacecraft                        
             spin plane, a 9m tip-to-tip tubular electric antenna deployed along the spacecraft spin                         
             axis, a short 0.6m electric antenna, mounted on the boom and oriented parallel                        
             to the long wire antenna, a magnetic loop antenna mounted on the boom and oriented                    
             to measure the component of the magnetic field parallel to the long wire antenna,                     
             and a magnetic search coil antenna, also mounted on a boom and oriented to                            
             measure the magnetic field parallel to the spacecraft spin axis.

             a Low Frequency Correlator (LFC), a Wideband Analog Receiver (WBR) and a Linear                       
             Wave Receiver (LWR).  Only the LFC data are included in these files.  The SFC
