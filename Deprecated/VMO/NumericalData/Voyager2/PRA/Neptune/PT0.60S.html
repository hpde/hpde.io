logical lines within a PRA frame. Each line comprises 800 values,<br>
representing 400 data pairs. In the high rate mode, the PRA measures<br>
the flux at two frequencies <em>simultaneously</em> and returns these two data<br>
sequentially. A sample pair is acquired every (actually every 138.88...<br>
microseconds), through an RC filter with a 100 microsecond time constant.<br>
A single line comprises 60 milliseconds of data. Lines are NOT contiguous<br>
in time. There is a 4444.44... microsecond gap between the ending of one<br>
line and the start of the succeeding line.</p>
<p>The PRA samples a frequency pair in this manner for 24 seconds. It then<br>
has the option of switching to a second pair for the final 24 seconds.<br>
These frequencies are designated Freq. 1 through Freq. 4 in the header.<br>
The data are presented such that the higher of the relevant frequency<br>
pair is presented first.</p>

acquired by the Voyager-2 Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) instrument<br>
during the Neptune encounter.  Since the PRA instrument is able to<br>
observe planetary phenomenon at much larger ranges than other fields<br>
and particles experiments, thus the PRA data cover a variable and<br>
longer encounter period. PRA lowband data provided here cover the<br>
entire Neptune Encounter Phase (1989-05-25 to 1989-09-27).</p>
<p>Each file within the dataset represents a single PRA high rate frame,<br>
of duration 48 seconds. Each file contains a 28 octet header, followed<br>
by 1280000 octets of data.</p>
<h2>The header format is described as below:</h2>
<h2>Length (bytes) Name            Contents</h2>
<p>2              Year            Year A.D.<br>

<p>where all values are unsigned, and multi-octet values are presented<br>
with the most significant byte first.</p>
<p>The data are 16 bit numbers, most significant byte first, with 0<br>
indicating unavailable data. The data are presented as a single<br>
stream of 16 bit numbers. The frame is logically divided into lines<br>
(although there is no indication of the lines within the file). This<br>
terminology comes from the fact that in this high rate mode, the PRA<br>
data are treated exactly as if they were imaging data, and a 48 second<br>
image comprises 800 horizontal scan lines. Similarly, there are 800<br>
logical lines within a PRA frame. Each line comprises 800 values,<br>
representing 400 data pairs. In the high rate mode, the PRA measures<br>
the flux at two frequencies <em>simultaneously</em> and returns these two data<br>
sequentially. A sample pair is acquired every (actually every 138.88...<br>
microseconds), through an RC filter with a 100 microsecond time constant.<br>
A single line comprises 60 milliseconds of data. Lines are NOT contiguous<br>
in time. There is a 4444.44... microsecond gap between the ending of one<br>
line and the start of the succeeding line.</p>
<p>The PRA samples a frequency pair in this manner for 24 seconds. It then<br>
has the option of switching to a second pair for the final 24 seconds.<br>
These frequencies are designated Freq. 1 through Freq. 4 in the header.<br>
The data are presented such that the higher of the relevant frequency<br>
pair is presented first.</p>
