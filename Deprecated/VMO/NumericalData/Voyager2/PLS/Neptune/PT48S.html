All parameters are          \n    obtained by fitting the observed spectra (current as a function           \n    of energy) with Maxwellian plasma distributions, using a non-linear       \n    least squares fitting routine to find the plasma parameters which,        \n    when coupled with the full instrument response, best simulate the         \n    data.  The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition          \n    is not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by the        \n    separation of the observed current peaks in energy (assuming the          \n    plasma is co-moving).  In the upstream solar wind protons are fit         \n    to the M-long data since high energy resolution is needed to obtain       \n    accurate plasma parameters.  In the magnetosheath the ion flux so         \n    low that several L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to increase      \n    the signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data could be           \n    reliably fit.  These averaged spectra were fit using 2 proton             \n    Maxwellians with the same velocity.  The values given in the              \n    upstream magnetosheath are the total density and the                      \n    density-weighted temperature. In both the upstream solar wind and         \n    magnetosheath full vector velocities, densities and temperatures          \n    are derived for each fit component.  In the magnetosphere spectra         \n    do not contain enough information to obtain full velocity vectors,        \n    so flow is assumed to be purely azimuthal.  In some cases the             \n    azimuthal velocity is a fit parameter, in some cases rigid                \n    corotation is assumed.  In the 'outer' magnetosphere (L&gt;5) two            \n    distinct current peaks appear in the spectra; these are fit               \n    assuming a composition of H+ and N+.  In the inner magnetosphere          \n    the plasma is hot and the composition is ambiguous, although two          \n    superimposed Maxwellians are still required to fit the data.              \n    These spectra are fit using two compositions, one with H+ and N+          \n    and the second with two H+ components.  The N+ composition is             \n    preferred by the data provider.  All fit values in the                    \n    magnetosphere come with one sigma errors.  It should be noted             \n    that no attempt has been made to account for the spacecraft               \n    potential, which is probably about -10 V in this region and will          \n    effect the density and velocity values.  In the outbound                  \n    magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit values are given         \n    for velocity, density, and thermal speed.  The signal-to-noise            \n    ratio in the M-longs is very low, especially near the magnetopause,       \n    which can result in the analysis giving incorrect values.  The            \n    L-long spectra have too low an energy resolution to permit accurate       \n    determinations parameters in many regions; in particular the              \n    temperature and non-radial velocity components may be inaccurate.         \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Parameters                                                                  \n  ==========                                                                  \n                                                                              \n    Derived Parameters                                                        \n    ------------------                                                        \n                                                                              \n      Sampling Parameter Name             : time                              \n      Sampling Parameter Resolution       : n/a                               \n      Minimum Sampling Parameter          : unk                               \n      Maximum Sampling Parameter          : unk                               \n      Sampling Parameter Interval         : unk                               \n      Minimum Available Sampling Interval : unk                               \n      Data Set Parameter Name             : ion density                       \n      Noise Level                         : unk                               \n      Data Set Parameter Unit             : cm**-3                            \n                                                                              \n      Ion density: A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per        \n      unit volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,        \n      or energy/nucleon.

In general, if more than one           \n      ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total density       \n      will be provided which is the sum of the ion densities.

<pre><code>This data set gives the best available values for ion densities,          
temperatures, and velocities near Neptune derived from data               
obtained by the Voyager 2 plasma experiment.  All parameters are          
obtained by fitting the observed spectra (current as a function           
of energy) with Maxwellian plasma distributions, using a non-linear       
least squares fitting routine to find the plasma parameters which,        
when coupled with the full instrument response, best simulate the         
data.  The PLS instrument measures energy/charge, so composition          
is not uniquely determined but can be deduced in some cases by the        
separation of the observed current peaks in energy (assuming the          
plasma is co-moving).  In the upstream solar wind protons are fit         
to the M-long data since high energy resolution is needed to obtain       
accurate plasma parameters.  In the magnetosheath the ion flux so         
low that several L-long spectra (3-5) had to be averaged to increase      
the signal-to-noise ratio to a level at which the data could be           
reliably fit.  These averaged spectra were fit using 2 proton             
Maxwellians with the same velocity.  The values given in the              
upstream magnetosheath are the total density and the                      
density-weighted temperature. In both the upstream solar wind and         
magnetosheath full vector velocities, densities and temperatures          
are derived for each fit component.  In the magnetosphere spectra         
do not contain enough information to obtain full velocity vectors,        
so flow is assumed to be purely azimuthal.  In some cases the             
azimuthal velocity is a fit parameter, in some cases rigid                
corotation is assumed.  In the 'outer' magnetosphere (L&amp;gt;5) two            
distinct current peaks appear in the spectra; these are fit               
assuming a composition of H+ and N+.  In the inner magnetosphere          
the plasma is hot and the composition is ambiguous, although two          
superimposed Maxwellians are still required to fit the data.              
These spectra are fit using two compositions, one with H+ and N+          
and the second with two H+ components.  The N+ composition is             
preferred by the data provider.  All fit values in the                    
magnetosphere come with one sigma errors.  It should be noted             
that no attempt has been made to account for the spacecraft               
potential, which is probably about -10 V in this region and will          
effect the density and velocity values.  In the outbound                  
magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit values are given         
for velocity, density, and thermal speed.  The signal-to-noise            
ratio in the M-longs is very low, especially near the magnetopause,       
which can result in the analysis giving incorrect values.  The            
L-long spectra have too low an energy resolution to permit accurate       
determinations parameters in many regions; in particular the              
temperature and non-radial velocity components may be inaccurate.

effect the density and velocity values.  In the outbound                  
magnetosheath and solar wind both moment and fit values are given         
for velocity, density, and thermal speed.  The signal-to-noise            
ratio in the M-longs is very low, especially near the magnetopause,       
which can result in the analysis giving incorrect values.  The            
L-long spectra have too low an energy resolution to permit accurate       
determinations parameters in many regions; in particular the              
temperature and non-radial velocity components may be inaccurate.

  Ion density: A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per        
  unit volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,        
  or energy/nucleon. Discrimination with regard to mass and or            
  charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however, mass        
  and charge state are often assumed due to instrument limitations.       
                                                                          
  Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               
  distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.)              
  or their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                
  moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will             
  be provided in a single dataset. In general, if more than one           
  ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total density       
  will be provided which is the sum of the ion densities. If a            
  plasma component does not have a Maxwellian distribution                
  the actual distribution can be represented as the sum of                
  several Maxwellians, in which case the density of each Maxwellian       
  is given.

  Ion temperature: A derived parameter giving an indication of the        
  mean energy/ion, assuming the shape of the ion energy spectrum to       
  be Maxwellian                                                           
  (i.e. highest entropy shape). Given that the                            
  ion energy spectrum is not exactly                                      
  Maxwellian, the ion temperature can be                                  
  defined integrally (whereby the mean energy                             
  obtained by integrating under the actual ion
