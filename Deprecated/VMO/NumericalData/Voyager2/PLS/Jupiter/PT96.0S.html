Discrimination with regard to mass and or               \n      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,             \n      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument               \n      limitations.                                                            \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               \n      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or           \n      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                   \n      moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will be          \n      provided in a single data set. In general, if more than one             \n      ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total               \n      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                    \n      densities.

Discrimination with regard to mass and or               \n      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,             \n      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument               \n      limitations.                                                            \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               \n      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or           \n      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                   \n      moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will be          \n      provided in a single data set. In general, if more than one             \n      ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total               \n      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                    \n      densities. If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian             \n      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as the          \n      sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of each           \n      Maxwellian is given.                                                    \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Source Instrument Parameters                                            \n      ============================                                            \n      Instrument Host ID              : VG2                                   \n      Data Set Parameter Name         : ION DENSITY                           \n      Instrument Parameter Name       : ION RATE                              \n                                        ION CURRENT                           \n                                        PARTICLE MULTIPLE PARAMETERS          \n      Important Instrument Parameters : 1 (for all parameters)                \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Processing                                                              \n      ==========                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n      Processing History                                                      \n      ------------------                                              ",

  This version 1.1 data set replaces the version 1.0 data set             
  (DATA_SET_ID = VG2-J-PLS-5-ION-MOM-96.0SEC) previously                  
  archived with the PDS.  This data set was given a new DATA_SET_ID       
  and intentionally marked as V1.0.                                       
                                                                          
                                                                          
  Data Set Description                                                    
  --------------------                                                    
  This data set contains the best estimates of the total ion              
  density from Voyager 2 at Jupiter in the PLS voltage range              
  (10-5950 eV/Q). It is calculated using the method of                    
  [MCNUTTETAL1981] which to first order consists of taking the            
  total measured current and dividing by the collector area and           
  plasma bulk velocity. This method is only accurate for high             
  mach number flows directly into the detector, and may result            
  in underestimates of the total density of a factor of 2 in the          
  outer magnetosphere. Thus absolute densities should be treated          
  with caution, but density variations in the data set can be             
  trusted. The low resolution mode density is used at all times           
  except day 190 2100-2200 when the larger of the high and low            
  resolution mode densities in a 96 sec period is used.                   
  Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a constant velocity            
  component of 200 km/s into the D cup is used outside of this.           
  These are the densities given in the [MCNUTTETAL1981] paper             
  corrected by a factor of 1.209 (.9617) for densities obtained           
  from the side (main) sensor. This correction is due to a                
  better calculation of the effective area of the sensors. Data           
  format: column 1 is time (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2           
  is the moment density in cm^-3. Each row has format (a24, 1x,           
  1pe9.2). Values of -9.99e+10 indicate that the parameter could          
  not be obtained from the data using the standard analysis               
  technique. Additional information about this data set and the           
  instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this             
  catalog. An overview of the data in this data set can be found          
  in [MCNUTTETAL1981] and a complete instrument description can           
  be found in [BRIDGEETAL1977].

  A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit                
  volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge, or          
  energy/nucleon. Discrimination with regard to mass and or               
  charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,             
  mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument               
  limitations.                                                            
                                                                          
                                                                          
  Many different forms of ion density are derived. Some are               
  distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or           
  their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                   
  moments). In some cases, more than one type of density will be          
  provided in a single data set. In general, if more than one             
  ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total               
  density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                    
  densities. If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian             
  distribution the actual distribution can be represented as the          
  sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of each           
  Maxwellian is given.

  This version 1.1 data set replaces the version 1.0 data set             
  (DATA_SET_ID = VG2-J-PLS-5-ION-MOM-96.0SEC) previously                  
  archived with the PDS.  This data set was given a new DATA_SET_ID       
  and intentionally marked as V1.0.                                       
                                                                          
                                                                          
  Data Set Description                                                    
  --------------------                                                    
  This data set contains the best estimates of the total ion              
  density from Voyager 2 at Jupiter in the PLS voltage range              
  (10-5950 eV/Q). It is calculated using the method of                    
  [MCNUTTETAL1981] which to first order consists of taking the            
  total measured current and dividing by the collector area and           
  plasma bulk velocity. This method is only accurate for high             
  mach number flows directly into the detector, and may result            
  in underestimates of the total density of a factor of 2 in the          
  outer magnetosphere. Thus absolute densities should be treated          
  with caution, but density variations in the data set can be             
  trusted. The low resolution mode density is used at all times           
  except day 190 2100-2200 when the larger of the high and low            
  resolution mode densities in a 96 sec period is used.                   
  Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a constant velocity            
  component of 200 km/s into the D cup is used outside of this.           
  These are the densities given in the [MCNUTTETAL1981] paper             
  corrected by a factor of 1.209 (.9617) for densities obtained           
  from the side (main) sensor. This correction is due to a                
  better calculation of the effective area of the sensors. Data           
  format: column 1 is time (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2           
  is the moment density in cm^-3. Each row has format (a24, 1x,           
  1pe9.2). Values of -9.99e+10 indicate that the parameter could          
  not be obtained from the data using the standard analysis               
  technique. Additional information about this data set and the           
  instrument which produced it can be found elsewhere in this             
  catalog. An overview of the data in this data set can be found          
  in [MCNUTTETAL1981] and a complete instrument description can           
  be found in [BRIDGEETAL1977].
