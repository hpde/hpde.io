The period covered is 1986/day 24/0000 SCET  to                     \n1986/day 27/0000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series                 \nof charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available            \nfrom the instrument.  The word approximates is used because                  \nthe angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the                   \nnature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,             \nand at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.                    \nWith the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged              \nfor those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are              \ntime averaged over an arbitrary period (24 seconds)                          \nfor the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle                 \naveraged records represent periods of time equal to 96 or 384                \nsec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called              \nthe LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is                   \nthe LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled                \nduring the scanning periods.                                                 \n                                                                             \n   Two scanning situations occurred during the time of this                  \ndata. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for                \neach of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;               \nnote that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), and 2) a special               \nUranus scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, scan,               \n7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 represents a 10.4 minute                  \nperiod when the instrument is fixed in sector 7, and where the               \nword scan represents a period of scanning (6 sec stepping                    \nfor a total scan time of 48 sec).  For this Uranus Scan data                 \nthe two adjacent scans within the Uranus scan cyclic have been               \naveraged together into a single, 96 sec record. The records                  \nof the 48 sec stepping mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 minutes.              \nAs stated in the first paragraph, the records for the periods                \nof no stepping during the Uranus scan cyclic (mode 2 above)                  \nare for 24 sec periods.                                                      \n                                                                             \n     The schedule of mode changes is as follows:                             \n                                                                             \n     prior to day 24/0420:      Mode (1)                                     \n                                                                             \n     24/0420  to  25/ 1357:     Mode (2)                                     \n                                                                             \n     after day 25/1357:         Mode (1)                                     \n                                                                             \nPlease note that the change-over between modes is not                        \ninstantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the                   \nscanning is not regular.

For the ions, it has been assumed                \nthat they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from                \nthe raw count rates via the relation:                                        \n                                                                             \n                    I  =  CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                    \n                                                                             \nwhere eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and                  \n(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton               \nvalues of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities             \nfor this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption           \nthat some other mass species dominates, one must convert back                \nto count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then                 \nconvert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the               \nmass species in question.  The parameters can be found in                    \nTable 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                 \nV. 86, page 8227, 1981).  The corresponding parameters for electrons         \ncan be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                \nV. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,             \nthe count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,                     \n(2) electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and             \n(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.                 \n                                                                             \n     The uncertainty parameters given with the data associated with          \neach channel (expressed as a percent) is the largest of the                  \ntwo quantities",

For the ions, it has been assumed                \nthat they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from                \nthe raw count rates via the relation:                                        \n                                                                             \n                    I  =  CR/(eG.(E2-E1),                                    \n                                                                             \nwhere eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and                  \n(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton               \nvalues of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities             \nfor this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption           \nthat some other mass species dominates, one must convert back                \nto count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then                 \nconvert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the               \nmass species in question.  The parameters can be found in                    \nTable 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                 \nV. 86, page 8227, 1981).  The corresponding parameters for electrons         \ncan be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,                \nV. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,             \nthe count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,                     \n(2) electron contamination of the lower energy ion channels, and             \n(3) solar UV contamination of the lowest energy ion channel.                 \n                                                                             \n     The uncertainty parameters given with the data associated with          \neach channel (expressed as a percent) is the largest of the                  \ntwo quantities",

Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft<br>
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet<br>
Uranus.  The period covered is 1986/day 24/0000 SCET  to<br>
1986/day 27/0000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series<br>
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available<br>
from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because<br>
the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the<br>
nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,<br>
and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.<br>
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged<br>
for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are<br>
time averaged over an arbitrary period (24 seconds)<br>
for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle<br>
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 96 or 384<br>
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called<br>
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is<br>
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled<br>
during the scanning periods.</p>
<p>Two scanning situations occurred during the time of this<br>
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for<br>
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;<br>
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), and 2) a special<br>
Uranus scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, scan,<br>
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 represents a 10.4 minute<br>
period when the instrument is fixed in sector 7, and where the<br>
word scan represents a period of scanning (6 sec stepping<br>
for a total scan time of 48 sec).  For this Uranus Scan data<br>
the two adjacent scans within the Uranus scan cyclic have been<br>
averaged together into a single, 96 sec record. The records<br>
of the 48 sec stepping mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 minutes.<br>
As stated in the first paragraph, the records for the periods<br>
of no stepping during the Uranus scan cyclic (mode 2 above)<br>
are for 24 sec periods.</p>
<pre><code> The schedule of mode changes is as follows:                             
                                                                         
 prior to day 24/0420:      Mode (1)                                     
                                                                         
 24/0420  to  25/ 1357:     Mode (2)                                     
                                                                         
 after day 25/1357:         Mode (1)                                     
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the change-over between modes is not<br>
instantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the<br>
scanning is not regular.  Not also that there were brief<br>
interruptions to, and changes in time phase in, the Mode (2)<br>
scan cyclic during the transitions into and out of the<br>
movable block periods that bracketed the close approach<br>
position (not shown above).</p>
<pre><code> Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample             
</code></pre>
<p>switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data<br>
a disjointed appearance.</p>

that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from<br>
the raw count rates via the relation:</p>

<p>where eG is geometric factor times detector efficiency, and<br>
(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton<br>
values of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities<br>
for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption<br>
that some other mass species dominates, one must convert back<br>
to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then<br>
convert to intensity using the parameters corresponding to the<br>
mass species in question.  The parameters can be found in<br>
Table 1 of Krimigis et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,<br>
V. 86, page 8227, 1981).  The corresponding parameters for electrons<br>
can be found in Mauk et al. (Journal of Geophysical Research,<br>
V. 92, page 15283, 1987).  Prior to the conversion to intensity,<br>
the count rates have been corrected for: (1) Background,<br>

Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft<br>
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet<br>
Uranus.  The period covered is 1986/day 24/0000 SCET  to<br>
1986/day 27/0000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series<br>
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available<br>
from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because<br>
the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the<br>
nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,<br>
and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.<br>
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged<br>
for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are<br>
time averaged over an arbitrary period (24 seconds)<br>
for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle<br>
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 96 or 384<br>
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called<br>
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is<br>
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled<br>
during the scanning periods.</p>
<p>Two scanning situations occurred during the time of this<br>
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for<br>
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;<br>
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), and 2) a special<br>
Uranus scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, scan,<br>
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 represents a 10.4 minute<br>
period when the instrument is fixed in sector 7, and where the<br>
word scan represents a period of scanning (6 sec stepping<br>
for a total scan time of 48 sec).  For this Uranus Scan data<br>
the two adjacent scans within the Uranus scan cyclic have been<br>
averaged together into a single, 96 sec record. The records<br>
of the 48 sec stepping mode (Mode 1 above) are for 6.4 minutes.<br>
As stated in the first paragraph, the records for the periods<br>
of no stepping during the Uranus scan cyclic (mode 2 above)<br>
are for 24 sec periods.</p>
<pre><code> The schedule of mode changes is as follows:                             
                                                                         
 prior to day 24/0420:      Mode (1)                                     
                                                                         
 24/0420  to  25/ 1357:     Mode (2)                                     
                                                                         
 after day 25/1357:         Mode (1)                                     
</code></pre>
<p>Please note that the change-over between modes is not<br>
instantaneous, and that for a few minutes the state of the<br>
scanning is not regular.  Not also that there were brief<br>
interruptions to, and changes in time phase in, the Mode (2)<br>
scan cyclic during the transitions into and out of the<br>
movable block periods that bracketed the close approach<br>
position (not shown above).</p>
<pre><code> Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample             
</code></pre>
<p>switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data<br>
a disjointed appearance.</p>
