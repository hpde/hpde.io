The period covered is 1989-08-24T00:00:00.000 SCET  to              \n1989-08-27T00:00:00.000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series           \nof charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available             \nfrom the instrument.  The word approximates is used because                   \nthe angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the                    \nnature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,              \nand at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.                     \nWith the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged               \nfor those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are               \ntime averaged over an arbitrary period (12 or 24 sec, see below)              \nfor the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle                  \naveraged records represent periods of time equal to 48 or 96                  \nsec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called               \nthe LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is                    \nthe LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled                 \nduring the scanning periods.                                                  \n                                                                              \n   Three scanning situations occurred during the time of this                 \ndata. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for                 \neach of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;                \nnote that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), 2) a special                    \nNeptune scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, 1, scan,            \n7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 and the 1 represent 5.2                    \nminute periods when the instrument is fixed in sectors 7 or 1,                \nrespectively, and where the word scan represents a period                     \nof scanning (6 sec stepping for a total scan time of 48 sec);                 \nand 3) periods when the detectors are fixed for more extended                 \nperiods in sector 7 (periods bracketing the ring plane crossings).            \nFor this Neptune Scan data, the 6.4 minute scan records during                \nstepping mode (1) have been time averaged to 12.8 minute records.             \nAlso, during stepping mode (2), the double scans that have no                 \nfixed periods between them have been averaged together into                   \na single (96 sec) record.  The single scans represent 48 sec                  \nrecords.  The schedule for the three stepping modes is as                     \nfollows:                                                                      \n                                                                              \n       prior to day 236/1600 SCET:     Mode (1)                               \n       236/1600 to 237/0239:           Mode (2)                               \n       237/0239 to 237/0319:           Mode (3)                               \n       237/0319 to 237/0503:           Mode (2)                               \n       237/0503 to 237/0554:           Mode (3)                               \n       237/0554 to 238/0400:           Mode (2)                               \n       after 237/0400:                 Mode (1)                               \n                                                                              \nObviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample                   \nswitching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data                \na disjointed appearance.                                                      \n                                                                              \n     Two channel sample modes also occurred during the Neptune                \nencounter.  These two modes affect this data set only by changing             \nthe primary record time length for the LECP Experiment Data Records           \n(EDR's). These time lengths have, in turn, been utilized for the              \naveraging times of this data set for non-stepping periods.

<pre><code> This data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy                 
</code></pre>
<p>Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft<br>
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet<br>
Neptune.  The period covered is 1989-08-24T00:00:00.000 SCET  to<br>
1989-08-27T00:00:00.000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series<br>
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available<br>
from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because<br>
the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the<br>
nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,<br>
and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.<br>
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged<br>
for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are<br>
time averaged over an arbitrary period (12 or 24 sec, see below)<br>
for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle<br>
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 48 or 96<br>
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called<br>
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is<br>
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled<br>
during the scanning periods.</p>
<p>Three scanning situations occurred during the time of this<br>
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for<br>
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;<br>
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), 2) a special<br>
Neptune scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, 1, scan,<br>
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 and the 1 represent 5.2<br>
minute periods when the instrument is fixed in sectors 7 or 1,<br>
respectively, and where the word scan represents a period<br>
of scanning (6 sec stepping for a total scan time of 48 sec);<br>
and 3) periods when the detectors are fixed for more extended<br>
periods in sector 7 (periods bracketing the ring plane crossings).<br>
For this Neptune Scan data, the 6.4 minute scan records during<br>
stepping mode (1) have been time averaged to 12.8 minute records.<br>
Also, during stepping mode (2), the double scans that have no<br>
fixed periods between them have been averaged together into<br>
a single (96 sec) record.  The single scans represent 48 sec<br>
records.  The schedule for the three stepping modes is as<br>
follows:</p>
<pre><code>   prior to day 236/1600 SCET:     Mode (1)                               
   236/1600 to 237/0239:           Mode (2)                               
   237/0239 to 237/0319:           Mode (3)                               
   237/0319 to 237/0503:           Mode (2)                               
   237/0503 to 237/0554:           Mode (3)                               
   237/0554 to 238/0400:           Mode (2)                               
   after 237/0400:                 Mode (1)                               
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample<br>
switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data<br>
a disjointed appearance.</p>
<pre><code> Two channel sample modes also occurred during the Neptune                
</code></pre>
<p>encounter.  These two modes affect this data set only by changing<br>
the primary record time length for the LECP Experiment Data Records<br>
(EDR's). These time lengths have, in turn, been utilized for the<br>
averaging times of this data set for non-stepping periods.  The<br>
schedule is:</p>

<pre><code> This data consists of resampled data from the Low Energy

<p>Charged Particle (LECP) Experiment on the Voyager 2 Spacecraft<br>
for the period when Voyager 2 was in the vicinity of the planet<br>
Neptune.  The period covered is 1989-08-24T00:00:00.000 SCET  to<br>
1989-08-27T00:00:00.000 SCET.  This data approximates a time series<br>
of charged particle fluxes from a selection of channels available<br>
from the instrument.  The word approximates is used because<br>
the angle scanning modes of the instrument complicates the<br>
nature of the data.  At times the instrument mechanically scans,<br>
and at times it is fixed to look at a specific direction.<br>
With the type of data given here, the fluxes are angle averaged<br>
for those time periods when the instrument is scanning, and are<br>
time averaged over an arbitrary period (12 or 24 sec, see below)<br>
for the periods when the detectors are stationary. The angle<br>
averaged records represent periods of time equal to 48 or 96<br>
sec (see below). This kind of data presentation has been called<br>
the LECP Scan data. Another form that is also available is<br>
the LECP Step data that gives the angle distributions sampled<br>
during the scanning periods.</p>
<p>Three scanning situations occurred during the time of this<br>
data. They are: 1) continuous 48 sec stepping (48 seconds for<br>
each of 8 look directions for a total of 6.4 minutes per scan;<br>
note that sector 8 is shielded with 2 mm Al), 2) a special<br>
Neptune scan cyclic with the following sequence: 7, scan, 1, scan,<br>
7, scan, scan, repeat; where the 7 and the 1 represent 5.2<br>
minute periods when the instrument is fixed in sectors 7 or 1,<br>
respectively, and where the word scan represents a period<br>
of scanning (6 sec stepping for a total scan time of 48 sec);<br>
and 3) periods when the detectors are fixed for more extended<br>
periods in sector 7 (periods bracketing the ring plane crossings).<br>
For this Neptune Scan data, the 6.4 minute scan records during<br>
stepping mode (1) have been time averaged to 12.8 minute records.<br>
Also, during stepping mode (2), the double scans that have no<br>
fixed periods between them have been averaged together into<br>
a single (96 sec) record.  The single scans represent 48 sec<br>
records.  The schedule for the three stepping modes is as<br>
follows:</p>
<pre><code>   prior to day 236/1600 SCET:     Mode (1)                               
   236/1600 to 237/0239:           Mode (2)                               
   237/0239 to 237/0319:           Mode (3)                               
   237/0319 to 237/0503:           Mode (2)                               
   237/0503 to 237/0554:           Mode (3)                               
   237/0554 to 238/0400:           Mode (2)                               
   after 237/0400:                 Mode (1)                               
</code></pre>
<p>Obviously these stepping mode changes, and the angle sample<br>
switching that occurs during stepping mode (2), gives the data<br>
a disjointed appearance.</p>
<pre><code> Two channel sample modes also occurred during the Neptune                
</code></pre>
<p>encounter.  These two modes affect this data set only by changing<br>
the primary record time length for the LECP Experiment Data Records<br>
(EDR's). These time lengths have, in turn, been utilized for the<br>
averaging times of this data set for non-stepping periods.  The<br>
schedule is:</p>
<pre><code>  prior to day 237/0200 SCET:  Far Encounter (24 sec records)             
                                                                          
  237/0200 to 237/0551:        Near Encounter (12 sec records)

<p>Please note that 3 of the electron channels are derived from<br>
4 of the instrumental channels by taking differences between<br>
adjacent (in energy) channels.</p>

that they consist only of protons.  Intensity is derived from<br>
the raw count rates via the relation:</p>

(E2-E1) is the band pass of the channel in energy.  The proton<br>
values of these parameters were used in deriving the intensities<br>
for this data set.  To obtain the Intensities under the assumption<br>
that some other mass species dominates, one must convert back<br>
to count rate (CR) utilizing the proton parameters, and then<br>
