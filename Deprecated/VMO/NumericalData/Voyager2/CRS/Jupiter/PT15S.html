It consists           \n      of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy                    \n      Telescopes (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET). The                  \n      detectors have large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster)          \n      and long electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low            \n      power consumption and good stability. Normally, the data are            \n      primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]          \n      and E) pulse-height information about individual events.                \n      Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and          \n      Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in          \n      single detectors and various coincidence rates. In inter-               \n      planetary space, guard counters are placed in anticoincidence           \n      with the primary detectors to reduce the background from                \n      high-energy particles penetrating through the sides of the              \n      telescopes. These guard counters were turned off in the Jovian          \n      magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence rate became           \n      high enough to block a substantial fraction of the desired              \n      counts. Fortunately, under these conditions the spectra were            \n      sufficiently soft that the background, due to penetrating               \n      particles, was small.                                                   \n                                                                              \n      The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained              \n      with the LET. The thicknesses of individual solid-state                 \n      detectors in the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen           \n      such that, even in the Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made,            \n      at most, a very minor contribution to the proton counting               \n      rates [LUPTON&amp;STONE1972]. Dead time corrections and accidental          \n      coincidences were small (&lt; 20%) throughout most of the                  \n      magnetotail, but were substantial (&gt; 50%) at flux maxima                \n      within 40 R[J] Of Jupiter. Data have been included in this              \n      package for those periods when the corrections are less than            \n      ~ 50% and can be corrected by the user with the dead time               \n      appropriate to the detector (2 to 25 [micro]sec). The high              \n      counting rates, however, caused some baseline shift which may           \n      have raised proton thresholds significantly. In the inner               \n      magnetosphere, the L[2] counting rate was still useful because          \n      it never rolled over. This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV                \n      protons penetrating L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &gt; 9-MeV protons           \n      penetrating the shield (8.4 cm^2 ster). For an E^-2 spectrum,           \n      the two groups would make comparable contributions; but in the          \n      magnetosphere, for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV              \n      [MCDONALDETAL1979], the contribution from protons penetrating           \n      the shield would be only 3 to 14%.                                      \n                                                                              \n      The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-                      \n      anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8            \n      MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution             \n      (~10^-3). Corrections are required for dead time losses in              \n      L[1], accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence              \n      losses from L[4]. Data are given only for periods when these            \n      corrections are relatively small. In addition to the rates              \n      listed in the table, the energy lost in detectors L[1], L[2]            \n      and L[3] was measured for individual particles. For protons,            \n      this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV. Protons             \n      can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs. E technique,           \n      their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly              \n      reduced. Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a              \n      small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and                  \n      statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged            \n      over a period of one hour.                                              \n                                                                              \n      HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-              \n      height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one           \n      another during periods of high counting rates. To prevent such          \n      an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,           \n      the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each            \n      192 seconds long. Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on            \n      at a time. LET-D was cycled through L[1] only and L[1]L[2]              \n      coincidence requirements. The TET was cycled through various            \n      coincidence conditions, including singles from the front                \n      detectors. At the expense of some time resolution, this                 \n      procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer          \n      magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage                \n      through the magnetotail region.                                         \n                                                                              \n      Some of the published results from this experiment required             \n      extensive corrections for dead time, accidental coincidences            \n      and anticoincidences ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B];                 \n      [SCHARDTETAL1981]; [GEHRELS1981]). These corrections can be             \n      applied only on a case-by-case basis after a careful study of           \n      the environment and many self-consistency checks. They cannot           \n      be applied on a systematic basis and we have no computer                \n      programs to do so; therefore, data from such periods are not            \n      included in the Data Center submission. The scientists on the           \n      CRS team will, however, be glad to consider special requests            \n      if the desired information can be extracted from the data.              \n                                                                              \n      Description of the Data                                         ",

<pre><code>  (The following description has been excerpted from                      
  [NSSDCCRS1979])                                                         
                                                                          
  As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was                 
  designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B]. It consists           
  of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy                    
  Telescopes (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET). The                  
  detectors have large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster)          
  and long electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low            
  power consumption and good stability. Normally, the data are            
  primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]          
  and E) pulse-height information about individual events.                
  Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and          
  Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in          
  single detectors and various coincidence rates. In inter-               
  planetary space, guard counters are placed in anticoincidence           
  with the primary detectors to reduce the background from                
  high-energy particles penetrating through the sides of the              
  telescopes. These guard counters were turned off in the Jovian          
  magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence rate became           
  high enough to block a substantial fraction of the desired              
  counts. Fortunately, under these conditions the spectra were            
  sufficiently soft that the background, due to penetrating               
  particles, was small.                                                   
                                                                          
  The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained              
  with the LET. The thicknesses of individual solid-state                 
  detectors in the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen           
  such that, even in the Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made,            
  at most, a very minor contribution to the proton counting               
  rates [LUPTON&amp;amp;STONE1972]. Dead time corrections and accidental          
  coincidences were small (&amp;lt; 20%) throughout most of the                  
  magnetotail, but were substantial (&amp;gt; 50%) at flux maxima                
  within 40 R[J] Of Jupiter. Data have been included in this              
  package for those periods when the corrections are less than            
  ~ 50% and can be corrected by the user with the dead time               
  appropriate to the detector (2 to 25 [micro]sec). The high              
  counting rates, however, caused some baseline shift which may           
  have raised proton thresholds significantly. In the inner               
  magnetosphere, the L[2] counting rate was still useful because          
  it never rolled over. This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV                
  protons penetrating L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &amp;gt; 9-MeV protons           
  penetrating the shield (8.4 cm^2 ster). For an E^-2 spectrum,           
  the two groups would make comparable contributions; but in the          
  magnetosphere, for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV              
  [MCDONALDETAL1979], the contribution from protons penetrating           
  the shield would be only 3 to 14%.                                      
                                                                          
  The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-                      
  anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8            
  MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution             
  (~10^-3). Corrections are required for dead time losses in              
  L[1], accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence              
  losses from L[4]. Data are given only for periods when these            
  corrections are relatively small. In addition to the rates              
  listed in the table, the energy lost in detectors L[1], L[2]            
  and L[3] was measured for individual particles. For protons,            
  this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV. Protons             
  can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs. E technique,           
  their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly              
  reduced. Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a              
  small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and                  
  statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged            
  over a period of one hour.                                              
                                                                          
  HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-              
  height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one           
  another during periods of high counting rates. To prevent such          
  an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,           
  the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each            
  192 seconds long. Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on            
  at a time. LET-D was cycled through L[1] only and L[1]L[2]              
  coincidence requirements. The TET was cycled through various            
  coincidence conditions, including singles from the front                
  detectors. At the expense of some time resolution, this                 
  procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer          
  magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage                
  through the magnetotail region.                                         
                                                                          
  Some of the published results from this experiment required             
  extensive corrections for dead time, accidental coincidences            
  and anticoincidences ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B];                 
  [SCHARDTETAL1981]; [GEHRELS1981]). These corrections can be             
  applied only on a case-by-case basis after a careful study of           
  the environment and many self-consistency checks. They cannot           
  be applied on a systematic basis and we have no computer                
  programs to do so; therefore, data from such periods are not            
  included in the Data Center submission. The scientists on the           
  CRS team will, however, be glad to consider special requests            
  if the desired information can be extracted from the data.

  magnetosphere, the L[2] counting rate was still useful because          
  it never rolled over. This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV                
  protons penetrating L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &amp;gt; 9-MeV protons           
  penetrating the shield (8.4 cm^2 ster). For an E^-2 spectrum,           
  the two groups would make comparable contributions; but in the          
  magnetosphere, for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV              
  [MCDONALDETAL1979], the contribution from protons penetrating           
  the shield would be only 3 to 14%.                                      
                                                                          
  The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-                      
  anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8            
  MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution             
  (~10^-3). Corrections are required for dead time losses in              
  L[1], accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence              
  losses from L[4]. Data are given only for periods when these            
  corrections are relatively small. In addition to the rates              
  listed in the table, the energy lost in detectors L[1], L[2]            
  and L[3] was measured for individual particles. For protons,            
  this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV. Protons             
  can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs. E technique,           
  their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly              
  reduced. Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a              
  small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and                  
  statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged            
  over a period of one hour.                                              
                                                                          
  HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-              
  height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one           
  another during periods of high counting rates. To prevent such          
  an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,           
  the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each            
  192 seconds long. Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on            
  at a time. LET-D was cycled through L[1] only and L[1]L[2]              
  coincidence requirements. The TET was cycled through various            
  coincidence conditions, including singles from the front                
  detectors. At the expense of some time resolution, this                 
  procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer          
  magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage                
  through the magnetotail region.                                         
                                                                          
  Some of the published results from this experiment required             
  extensive corrections for dead time, accidental coincidences            
  and anticoincidences ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B];                 
  [SCHARDTETAL1981]; [GEHRELS1981]). These corrections can be             
  applied only on a case-by-case basis after a careful study of           
  the environment and many self-consistency checks. They cannot           
  be applied on a systematic basis and we have no computer                
  programs to do so; therefore, data from such periods are not            
  included in the Data Center submission. The scientists on the           
  CRS team will, however, be glad to consider special requests            
  if the desired information can be extracted from the data.
