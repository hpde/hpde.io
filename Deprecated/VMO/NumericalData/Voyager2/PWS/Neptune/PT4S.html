The time associated       \n    with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the             \n    beginning of the scan.  During data gaps where complete 4-second          \n    spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the           \n    gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  When one or         \n    more channels are missing within a scan, the missing measurements         \n    are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not calibrated.  The data           \n    numbers in this data set can be plotted in raw form for event             \n    searches and simple trend analysis since they are roughly                 \n    proportional to the log of the electric field strength.                   \n    Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use with this          \n    data set;  the use of these is described below.                           \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Parameters                                                                  \n  ==========                                                                  \n                                                                              \n    Derived Parameters                                                        \n    ------------------                                                        \n                                                                              \n      Sampling Parameter Name             : TIME                              \n      Sampling Parameter Resolution       : 4.0 seconds                       \n      Minimum Sampling Parameter          : N/A                               \n      Maximum Sampling Parameter          : N/A                               \n      Sampling Parameter Interval         : 4.0 seconds                       \n      Minimum Available Sampling Interval : 4.0 seconds                       \n      Data Set Parameter Name             : plasma wave spectrum              \n      Noise Level                         : 0.000005 V/m                      \n      Data Set Parameter Unit             : volts/meter                       \n                                                                              \n      Plasma wave spectrum: A set of derived parameters consisting of         \n      wave electric field intensities or electric field spectral              \n      densities at various contiguous frequencies over                        \n      a range of frequencies.

The MSF, or Master Science Files, are produced at the        \n      University of Iowa as the primary, ordered, full-information PWS        \n      spectrum analyzer data set.  The CD files contain uncalibrated,         \n      full-resolution PWS data with minimal ancillary data in a               \n      simplified format which may be used in CDROM production.                \n                                                                              \n      NOTE: SOFTWARE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC USE.                         \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n    Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                     \n    -------------------------------------                                     \n      The Voyager PWS calibration tables are given in two plain ASCII         \n      text files named VG1PWSCL.TAB and VG2PWSCL.TAB (for Voyagers-1 and      \n      -2, respectively).

Each line             \n      contains calibrations for successive data number values ranging         \n      from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually represents the lack of     \n      data since the baseline noise values for each channel are all above     \n      that.)                                                                  \n                                                                      ",

The MSF, or Master Science Files, are produced at the        \n      University of Iowa as the primary, ordered, full-information PWS        \n      spectrum analyzer data set.  The CD files contain uncalibrated,         \n      full-resolution PWS data with minimal ancillary data in a               \n      simplified format which may be used in CDROM production.                \n                                                                              \n      NOTE: SOFTWARE IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR PUBLIC USE.                         \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n    Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                     \n    -------------------------------------                                     \n      The Voyager PWS calibration tables are given in two plain ASCII         \n      text files named VG1PWSCL.TAB and VG2PWSCL.TAB (for Voyagers-1 and      \n      -2, respectively).  These provide information to convert the            \n      uncalibrated `data number' output of the PWS 16-channel spectrum        \n      analyzer to calibrated antenna voltages for each frequency channel.     \n      These calibration files are always provided with the dataset when       \n      the data are extracted from PDS by a user. Following is a brief         \n      description of these files and a tutorial in their application.         \n                                                                              \n      The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by the      \n      corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16              \n      frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each line             \n      contains calibrations for successive data number values ranging         \n      from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually represents the lack of     \n      data since the baseline noise values for each channel are all above     \n      that.)                                                                  \n                                                                      ",

<pre><code>This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric field            
intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver (PWS) spectrum        
analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Neptunian magnetosphere.         
For each 4-second interval, a field strength is determined for each       
of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range       
from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically             
spaced in frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated       
with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the             
beginning of the scan.  During data gaps where complete 4-second          
spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the           
gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  When one or         
more channels are missing within a scan, the missing measurements         
are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not calibrated.  The data           
numbers in this data set can be plotted in raw form for event             
searches and simple trend analysis since they are roughly                 
proportional to the log of the electric field strength.                   
Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use with this          
data set;  the use of these is described below.

Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                     
-------------------------------------                                     
  The Voyager PWS calibration tables are given in two plain ASCII         
  text files named VG1PWSCL.TAB and VG2PWSCL.TAB (for Voyagers-1 and      
  -2, respectively).  These provide information to convert the            
  uncalibrated `data number' output of the PWS 16-channel spectrum        
  analyzer to calibrated antenna voltages for each frequency channel.     
  These calibration files are always provided with the dataset when       
  the data are extracted from PDS by a user. Following is a brief         
  description of these files and a tutorial in their application.         
                                                                          
  The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by the      
  corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16              
  frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.  Each line             
  contains calibrations for successive data number values ranging         
  from 0 through 255.  (Data number 0 actually represents the lack of     
  data since the baseline noise values for each channel are all above     
  that.)

<pre><code>This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric field            
intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver (PWS) spectrum        
analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Neptunian magnetosphere.         
For each 4-second interval, a field strength is determined for each       
of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range       
from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically             
spaced in frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated       
with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the             
beginning of the scan.  During data gaps where complete 4-second          
spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file, that is, the           
gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any other way.  When one or         
more channels are missing within a scan, the missing measurements         
are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not calibrated.  The data           
numbers in this data set can be plotted in raw form for event             
searches and simple trend analysis since they are roughly                 
proportional to the log of the electric field strength.                   
Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use with this          
data set;  the use of these is described below.
