Data after 2013-12-31 will be added to the archive      \n    on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum\n    analyzer observations obtained in the cruise mission phases\n    before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases\n    as well as those obtained during the two encounter phases.\n\n    The Voyager 2 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 80 AU over\n    the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when\n    some key events occurred during the mission, the following table\n    is provided.\n\n    Date         Event\n    1977-08-20   Launch\n    1979-07-02   First inbound bow shock crossing at Jupiter\n    1979-08-03   Last outbound bow shock crossing at Jupiter\n    1981-08-24   First inbound bow shock crossing at Saturn\n    1981-08-31   Last outbound bow shock crossing at Saturn\n    1982-04-26   10 AU\n    1983-08-30   Onset of first major LF heliospheric radio event\n    1986-01-24   First inbound bow shock crossing at Uranus\n    1986-01-29   Last outbound bow shock crossing at Uranus\n    1986-05-26   20 AU\n    1989-08-07   30 AU\n    1989-08-24   First inbound bow shock crossing at Neptune\n    1989-08-28   Last outbound bow shock crossing at Neptune\n    1992-07-06   Onset of second major LF heliospheric radio event\n    1993-05-08   40 AU\n    1996-10-10   50 AU\n    2000-01-27   60 AU\n    2002-11-01   Onset of third major LF heliospheric radio event\n    2003-04-21   70 AU\n    2006-07-01   80 AU\n    2009-09-03   90 AU\n    2012-11-04   100 AU\n\n\n  Data Sampling\n  =============\n    This data set consists of full resolution edited, wave electric\n    field intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum\n    analyzer obtained during the entire mission.  For each time\n    interval, a field strength is determined for each of the 16\n    spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10\n    Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in\n    frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated with\n    each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning\n    of the scan.  The time between spectra in this data set vary by\n    telemetry mode and range from 4 seconds to 96 seconds.  During\n    data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries exist in\n    the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any\n    other way.  When one or more channels are missing within a scan,\n    the missing measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not\n    calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in\n    raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they\n    are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field\n    strength.  Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use\n    with this data set; the use of these is described below.\n\n    For the cruise data sets, the timing of samples is dependent upon\n    the spacecraft telemetry mode.  In principle, one can determine\n    the temporal resolution between spectra simply by noting the\n    difference in time between two records in the files.  In some\n    studies, more precise timing information is necessary.  Here, we\n    describe the timing of the samples for the PWS low rate data as a\n    function of telemetry mode.\n\n    The PWS instrument uses two logarithmic compressors as detectors\n    for the 16-channel spectrum analyzer, one for the bottom (lower\n    frequency) 8 channels, and one for the upper (higher frequency) 8\n    channels.  For each bank of 8 channels, the compressor\n    sequentially steps from the lowest frequency of the 8 to the\n    highest in a regular time step to obtain a complete spectrum.  At\n    each time step, the higher frequency channel is sampled 1/8 s\n    prior to the lower frequency channel so that the channels are\n    sampled in the following order with channel 1 being the lowest\n    frequency channel (10 Hz) and 16 being the highest (56.2 kHz): 9,\n    1, 10, 2, 11, 3, ...  15, 7, 16, 8.  The primary difference\n    between the various data modes is the stepping rate from one\n    channel to the next (ranging from 0.5 to 12 s, corresponding to\n    temporal resolutions between complete spectra of 4 s to 96 s).\n\n    In the following table, we present the hexadecimal id for the\n    various telemetry modes, the mode mnemonic ID, the time between\n    frequency steps, and the time between complete spectra.  We also\n    provide the offset from the beginning of the instrument cycle (one\n    complete spectrum) identified as the time of each record's time\n    tag to the time of the sampling for the first high-frequency\n    channel (channel 9) and for the first low-frequency channel\n    (channel 1).\n\n                                    Time\n                        Frequency   Between      High Freq.

One of every 12 sets of sums is\n    dropped on board in order to avoid LECP stepper motor\n    interference.\n\n\n  Data Processing\n  ===============\n    The spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where data are\n    available) low resolution data set which provides wave intensity as\n    a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and time (one\n    spectrum per time intervals ranging from 4 seconds to 96 seconds,\n    depending on telemetry mode).  The data are typically plotted as\n    amplitude vs. time for one or more of the channels in a strip-chart\n    like display, or can be displayed as a frequency-time spectrogram\n    using a gray- or color-bar to indicate amplitude.  With only sixteen\n    channels, it is usually best to stretch the frequency axis by\n    interpolating from one frequency channel to the next either linearly\n    or with a spline fit.  One must be aware if the frequency axis is\n    stretched that more resolution may be implied than is really\n    present.  The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII\n    text file named VG2PWSCL.TAB (for Voyager-2).  This provides\n    information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output of the\n    PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna voltages for\n    each frequency channel.  Following is a brief description of this\n    file and a tutorial in its application.\n\n    Descriptive headers have been removed from this file.  The columns\n    included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02, ICHAN03, ICHAN04, ICHAN05,\n    ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.\n\n    The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by the\n    corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16\n    frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer.

<pre><code>This data set consists of electric field spectrum analyzer data
from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Subsystem obtained during the
entire mission.  Data after 2013-12-31 will be added to the archive

analyzer observations obtained in the cruise mission phases
before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases
as well as those obtained during the two encounter phases.

The Voyager 2 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 80 AU over
the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when
some key events occurred during the mission, the following table

<h1>Data Sampling</h1>
<pre><code>This data set consists of full resolution edited, wave electric
field intensities from the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum
analyzer obtained during the entire mission.  For each time
interval, a field strength is determined for each of the 16
spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10
Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in
frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated with
each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning
of the scan.  The time between spectra in this data set vary by
telemetry mode and range from 4 seconds to 96 seconds.  During
data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries exist in
the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any
other way.  When one or more channels are missing within a scan,
the missing measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not
calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in
raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they
are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field
strength.  Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use
with this data set; the use of these is described below.

For the cruise data sets, the timing of samples is dependent upon
the spacecraft telemetry mode.  In principle, one can determine
the temporal resolution between spectra simply by noting the
difference in time between two records in the files.  In some
studies, more precise timing information is necessary.  Here, we
describe the timing of the samples for the PWS low rate data as a
function of telemetry mode.

The PWS instrument uses two logarithmic compressors as detectors
for the 16-channel spectrum analyzer, one for the bottom (lower
frequency) 8 channels, and one for the upper (higher frequency) 8
channels.  For each bank of 8 channels, the compressor
sequentially steps from the lowest frequency of the 8 to the
highest in a regular time step to obtain a complete spectrum.  At
each time step, the higher frequency channel is sampled 1/8 s
prior to the lower frequency channel so that the channels are
sampled in the following order with channel 1 being the lowest
frequency channel (10 Hz) and 16 being the highest (56.2 kHz): 9,
1, 10, 2, 11, 3, ...  15, 7, 16, 8.  The primary difference
between the various data modes is the stepping rate from one
channel to the next (ranging from 0.5 to 12 s, corresponding to
temporal resolutions between complete spectra of 4 s to 96 s).

In the following table, we present the hexadecimal id for the
various telemetry modes, the mode mnemonic ID, the time between
frequency steps, and the time between complete spectra.  We also
provide the offset from the beginning of the instrument cycle (one
complete spectrum) identified as the time of each record's time
tag to the time of the sampling for the first high-frequency
channel (channel 9) and for the first low-frequency channel
(channel 1).

<h1>Data Processing</h1>
<pre><code>The spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where data are
available) low resolution data set which provides wave intensity as
a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and time (one
spectrum per time intervals ranging from 4 seconds to 96 seconds,
depending on telemetry mode).  The data are typically plotted as
amplitude vs. time for one or more of the channels in a strip-chart
like display, or can be displayed as a frequency-time spectrogram
using a gray- or color-bar to indicate amplitude.  With only sixteen
channels, it is usually best to stretch the frequency axis by
interpolating from one frequency channel to the next either linearly
or with a spline fit.  One must be aware if the frequency axis is
stretched that more resolution may be implied than is really
present.  The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII
text file named VG2PWSCL.TAB (for Voyager-2).  This provides
information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output of the
PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna voltages for
each frequency channel.  Following is a brief description of this
file and a tutorial in its application.

Descriptive headers have been removed from this file.  The columns
included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02, ICHAN03, ICHAN04, ICHAN05,
ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.

The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by the
corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16
