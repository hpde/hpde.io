Each 60-msec interval constitutes           \n    a line of waveform samples.  The data set includes frames of              \n    waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, or 48 seconds,            \n    each.  The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical            \n    to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as                    \n    constructs in describing the form of the data.                            \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Data Processing                                                             \n  ===============                                                             \n    Because there is no direct method for calibrating these data and          \n    because the raw format of packed, 4-bit samples is                        \n    space-efficient, these data are not processed for archiving.              \n    The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform;          \n    this is useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the            \n    spacecraft.  But the normal method of analyzing the waveform              \n    data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to             \n    arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.  By stacking            \n    the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-time                  \n    spectrogram can be produced.                                              \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Data                                                                        \n  ====                                                                        \n    The waveforms are collections of samples of the electric field            \n    measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800               \n    samples per second.  The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital            \n    values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but           \n    the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain            \n    control used in the waveform receiver.  The instantaneous                 \n    dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 dB, but           \n    the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the              \n    passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the                 \n    instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain control, the overall          \n    dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 dB.  The              \n    automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the                \n    ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data.             \n    However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier            \n    transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the                 \n    spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained           \n    in most cases.                                                            \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Ancillary Data                                                              \n  ==============                                                              \n    None                                                                      \n                                                                              \n                                                                              \n  Coordinates                                                                 \n  ===========                                                                 \n    The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole           \n    pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.          \n    However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured               \n    field to any particular direction such as the local magnetic              \n    field or direction to a planet.

<pre><code>This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from            
the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Subsystem waveform receiver obtained            
during the entire mission.  Data after 2006-03-07 will be added to the    
archive on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all              
waveform observations obtained in the cruise mission phases               
before, between, and after the Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and               
Neptune encounter phases as well as those obtained during the             
four encounter phases.                                                    
                                                                          
The Voyager 2 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 80 AU over          
the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when            
some key events occurred during the mission, the following table          
is provided.

<h1>Data Sampling</h1>
<pre><code>The waveform is sampled at 4-bit resolution through a bandpass            
filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  1600 samples are              
collected in 55.56 msec (at a rate of 28,800 samples per second)          
followed by a 4.44-msec gap.  Each 60-msec interval constitutes           
a line of waveform samples.  The data set includes frames of              
waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, or 48 seconds,            
each.  The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical            
to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as                    
constructs in describing the form of the data.                            
</code></pre>
<h1>Data Processing</h1>
<pre><code>Because there is no direct method for calibrating these data and          
because the raw format of packed, 4-bit samples is                        
space-efficient, these data are not processed for archiving.              
The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform;          
this is useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the            
spacecraft.  But the normal method of analyzing the waveform              
data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to             
arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.  By stacking            
the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-time                  
spectrogram can be produced.

<h1>Data</h1>
<pre><code>The waveforms are collections of samples of the electric field            
measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800               
samples per second.  The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital            
values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but           
the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain            
control used in the waveform receiver.  The instantaneous                 
dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 dB, but           
the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the              
passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the                 
instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain control, the overall          
dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 dB.  The              
automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the                
ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data.             
However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier            
transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the                 
spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained           
in most cases.

<h1>Coordinates</h1>
<pre><code>The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole           
pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.          
However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured               
field to any particular direction such as the local magnetic              
field or direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft

<pre><code>This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from            
the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Subsystem waveform receiver obtained            
during the entire mission.  Data after 2006-03-07 will be added to the    
archive on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all              
waveform observations obtained in the cruise mission phases               
before, between, and after the Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and               
Neptune encounter phases as well as those obtained during the             
four encounter phases.                                                    
                                                                          
The Voyager 2 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 80 AU over          
the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when            
some key events occurred during the mission, the following table          
is provided.

<h1>Data Sampling</h1>
<pre><code>The waveform is sampled at 4-bit resolution through a bandpass            
filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  1600 samples are              
collected in 55.56 msec (at a rate of 28,800 samples per second)          
followed by a 4.44-msec gap.  Each 60-msec interval constitutes           
a line of waveform samples.  The data set includes frames of              
waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, or 48 seconds,            
each.  The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical            
to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as                    
constructs in describing the form of the data.                            
</code></pre>
<h1>Data Processing</h1>
<pre><code>Because there is no direct method for calibrating these data and          
because the raw format of packed, 4-bit samples is                        
space-efficient, these data are not processed for archiving.              
The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform;          
this is useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the            
spacecraft.  But the normal method of analyzing the waveform              
data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to             
arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.  By stacking            
the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-time                  
spectrogram can be produced.                                              
</code></pre>
<h1>Data</h1>
<pre><code>The waveforms are collections of samples of the electric field            
measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800               
samples per second.  The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital            
values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but           
the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain            
control used in the waveform receiver.  The instantaneous                 
dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 dB, but           
the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the              
passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the                 
instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain control, the overall          
dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 dB.  The              
automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the                
ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data.             
However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier            
transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the                 
spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained           
in most cases.                                                            
</code></pre>
<h1>Ancillary Data</h1>
<pre><code>None                                                                      
</code></pre>
<h1>Coordinates</h1>
<pre><code>The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole           
pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.          
However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured               
field to any particular direction such as the local magnetic              
field or direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft           
remains in a 3-axis stabilized orientation almost continuously,</code></pre>
