Data after 2013-12-31 will be added to the archive on          \n    subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum analyzer      \n    observations obtained in the cruise mission phases before, between,\n    and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases as well as those\n    obtained during the two encounter phases.\n\n    The Voyager 2 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 75 AU over the\n    course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when some key\n    events occurred during the mission, the following table is provided.\n\n    Date         Event\n    1977-08-20   Launch\n    1979-07-02   First inbound bow shock crossing at Jupiter\n    1979-08-03   Last outbound bow shock crossing at Jupiter\n    1981-08-24   First inbound bow shock crossing at Saturn\n    1981-08-31   Last outbound bow shock crossing at Saturn\n    1982-04-26   10 AU\n    1983-08-30   Onset of first major LF heliospheric radio event\n    1986-01-24   First inbound bow shock crossing at Uranus\n    1986-01-29   Last outbound bow shock crossing at Uranus\n    1986-05-26   20 AU\n    1989-08-07   30 AU\n    1989-08-24   First inbound bow shock crossing at Neptune\n    1989-08-28   Last outbound bow shock crossing at Neptune\n    1992-07-06   Onset of second major LF heliospheric radio event\n    1993-05-08   40 AU\n    1996-10-10   50 AU\n    2000-01-27   60 AU\n    2002-11-01   Onset of third major LF heliospheric radio event\n    2003-04-21   70 AU\n    2006-07-01   80 AU\n    2009-09-03   90 AU\n    2012-11-04   100 AU\n\n\n  Data Sampling\n  =============\n    This data set consists of average and peak wave electric field\n    intensities accumulated over 1-hour intervals from the Voyager 2\n    Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained during the entire\n    mission.  For each 1-hour time interval squares of the calibrated\n    electric field measurements obtained during each hour-long interval\n    in each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels are summed and then\n    divided by the number of measurements.  The square root of the\n    resulting value is obtained and stored as the average electric field\n    strength for the respective channel.  During the same hour-long\n    interval, the maximum electric field strength acquired in each of\n    the 16 channels is also recorded and stored as the peak electric\n    field strength for the respective channel.  Hence, for each hour, an\n    average and peak electric field spectrum from 10 Hz to 56.2 kHz is\n    obtained.  The 16 spectrum analyzer channels have center frequencies\n    that range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and are logarithmically\n    spaced in frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated\n    with each peak and average spectrum is the time of the beginning of\n    the averaging interval.  Given variations in the sweep rate of the\n    instrument (from a minimum of 4 seconds/sweep to a maximum of 96\n    seconds/sweep) the maximum number of samples in an hour-long\n    interval can range from 900 to 38.  Data gaps within the interval\n    can further reduce the number of samples.\n\n    During data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries\n    exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged\n    in any other way.\n\n\n  Data Processing\n  ===============\n    The spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where data are\n    available) low resolution data set which provides wave intensity as\n    a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and time (one\n    spectrum per time intervals ranging from 4 seconds to 96 seconds in\n    the full-resolution data set, depending on telemetry mode.) This\n    data set includes one-hour average and peak values for each channel.\n    The data are typically plotted as amplitude vs. time for one or more\n    of the channels in a strip-chart like display, or can be displayed\n    as a frequency-time spectrogram using a gray- or color-bar to\n    indicate amplitude.  With only sixteen channels, it is usually best\n    to stretch the frequency axis by interpolating from one frequency\n    channel to the next either linearly or with a spline fit.  One must\n    be aware if the frequency axis is stretched that more resolution may\n    be implied than is really present.\n\n    The measurements provided in the average and peak electric field\n    spectra included in this data set are in units of electric field\n    (volts/meter).\n\n    Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square of the\n    electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth of the\n    corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.\n\n      specdens = (efield(ichan))**2 / bandwidth(ichan)\n\n    Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral density\n    by the impedance of free space in ohms:\n\n      pwrflux = (efield(ichan))**2 / bandwidth(ichan) / 376.73\n\n    The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum analyzer\n    channel for each Voyager spacecraft are given below:\n\n      VOYAGER 2 PWS SPECTRUM ANALYZER\n      Voyager-2\n      Channel    Center Frequency      Bandwidth\n          1          10.0  Hz           2.16 Hz\n          2          17.8  Hz           3.58 Hz\n          3          31.1  Hz           4.50 Hz\n          4          56.2  Hz          10.7  Hz\n          5         100.

<pre><code>This data set consists of electric field spectrum analyzer data from
the Voyager 2 Plasma Wave Subsystem obtained during the entire
mission.  Data after 2013-12-31 will be added to the archive on          
subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum analyzer      
observations obtained in the cruise mission phases before, between,
and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases as well as those
obtained during the two encounter phases.

The Voyager 2 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 75 AU over the
course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when some key
events occurred during the mission, the following table is provided.

<h1>Data Sampling</h1>
<pre><code>This data set consists of average and peak wave electric field
intensities accumulated over 1-hour intervals from the Voyager 2
Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum analyzer obtained during the entire
mission.  For each 1-hour time interval squares of the calibrated
electric field measurements obtained during each hour-long interval
in each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels are summed and then
divided by the number of measurements.  The square root of the
resulting value is obtained and stored as the average electric field
strength for the respective channel.  During the same hour-long
interval, the maximum electric field strength acquired in each of
the 16 channels is also recorded and stored as the peak electric
field strength for the respective channel.  Hence, for each hour, an
average and peak electric field spectrum from 10 Hz to 56.2 kHz is
obtained.  The 16 spectrum analyzer channels have center frequencies
that range from 10 Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and are logarithmically
spaced in frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated
with each peak and average spectrum is the time of the beginning of
the averaging interval.  Given variations in the sweep rate of the
instrument (from a minimum of 4 seconds/sweep to a maximum of 96
seconds/sweep) the maximum number of samples in an hour-long
interval can range from 900 to 38.  Data gaps within the interval
can further reduce the number of samples.

During data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries
exist in the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged
in any other way.
</code></pre>
<h1>Data Processing</h1>
<pre><code>The spectrum analyzer data are a continuous (where data are
available) low resolution data set which provides wave intensity as
a function of frequency (16 log-spaced channels) and time (one
spectrum per time intervals ranging from 4 seconds to 96 seconds in
the full-resolution data set, depending on telemetry mode.) This
data set includes one-hour average and peak values for each channel.
The data are typically plotted as amplitude vs. time for one or more
of the channels in a strip-chart like display, or can be displayed
as a frequency-time spectrogram using a gray- or color-bar to
indicate amplitude.  With only sixteen channels, it is usually best
to stretch the frequency axis by interpolating from one frequency
channel to the next either linearly or with a spline fit.  One must
be aware if the frequency axis is stretched that more resolution may
be implied than is really present.

The measurements provided in the average and peak electric field
spectra included in this data set are in units of electric field
(volts/meter).

Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square of the
electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth of the
corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.

  specdens = (efield(ichan))**2 / bandwidth(ichan)

Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral density
by the impedance of free space in ohms:

  pwrflux = (efield(ichan))**2 / bandwidth(ichan) / 376.73

The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum analyzer
channel for each Voyager spacecraft are given below:

A failure in the Voyager 2 Flight Data System which occurred about 3
months after launch has adversely affected the calibration of PWS
channels 9 through 16.  An algorithm has been devised to partially
correct for this failure, and has proven useful for Voyager 2
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune encounters, but is not valid
for Earth-Jupiter cruise and may be modified in the future.  The
following implementation of this correction algorithm in FORTRAN
assumes that uncalibrated data numbers are stored in a 16-element
integer array, idn, with the array index equal to the PWS channel
number:

  c     'the old noise level' for vg2 pws

        real tonl(9:16) /2.0, 1.0, -1.0, -2.0, -3.0, 1.0, 2.0, 1.0/

        do ichan = 9, 16
          if (idn(ichan) .gt. 0) then
            if (idn(ichan) .lt. 64) idn(ichan) = 64
            if (idn(ichan) .le. 72) then
              idn(ichan) = int (tonl(ichan) - 530.4 +
       &amp;amp;                   8.6 * float (idn(ichan)))
            else
              idn(ichan) = int (tonl(ichan) + 20.113 +
       &amp;amp;                   0.99 * float (idn(ichan)))
            end if
          end if
        end do

This correction has been applied to the appropriate data in this
data set.
