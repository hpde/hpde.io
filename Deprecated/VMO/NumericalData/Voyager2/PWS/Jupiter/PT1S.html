These frequency measurements were taken from \n    Voyager 2 electric field waveform samples from Voyager 2 Plasma \n    Wave Science (PWS) waveform receiver obtained during its Jupiter \n    flyby.  The data set includes select measurements from spacecraft\n    event time (SCET) 1979-07-04T23:44:47.500Z to \n    1979-07-11T23:58:22.500Z.  The data are separated into day files\n    and the individual data points are taken every 1-second.  As will\n    be explained in more detail below, the frequency measurements and \n    therefore the density measurements in this data set are measured \n    from high-resolution wideband plasma wave spectra.  To learn more \n    about these spectra and their specific submitted volumes, see the \n    Related PDS Products section in the AAREADME files found in the \n    root directory of this volume. \n  \n  Parameters\n  ==========\n    While the data essential to this volume are the electron plasma\n    densities, there are a number of other plasma parameters included \n    with this data.  The data set consists of ASCII files with one\n    record per time step, occurring in 1-second increments.  Each\n    record includes the time, magnetic field strength (obtained from\n    the Voyager 2 magnetometer), the electron cyclotron frequency (if\n    available), the frequency of the cutoff or resonance measured, a \n    code indicating the name of the frequency measured, the calculated\n    electron density, and a set of position coordinates for the \n    spacecraft at the time of the observation.  Also included in each\n    record are the electron plasma frequency fpe, extraordinary mode \n    cutoff frequency fR=0, ordinary mode cutoff frequency fL=0, upper\n    hybrid resonance frequency fUH, and a quality index.  One of these\n    four frequencies is just a copy of the measured cutoff or resonance\n    frequency while the remaining frequencies are calculated using the\n    magnetic field data and the equations of cold plasma theory.  \n    Different files are used for each day.\n\n  Processing\n  ==========\n    The ASCII density data files produced in this volume were derived\n    from measuring the characteristic frequencies from the local plasma.\n    The density was calculated from these data, along with cyclotron\n    frequency data derived from magnetic field data, using the equations\n    of cold plasma theory. \n    \n    In order to measure these characteristic frequencies, this work \n    utilizes a new program that allows the operator to highlight the \n    general vicinity of the cutoff or resonance on a frequency-time \n    spectrogram.  Then, an algorithm finds the cutoff or resonance in \n    the region and records the frequency at 1 second intervals.  Hence,\n    the automated procedure has a high temporal resolution (1 second) \n    and requires a relatively low level of both manual effort and\n    subjective judgment by the operator.\n  \n    There are two different algorithms used: one for cutoff detection\n    and one for resonance or peak detection.  The cutoff detection \n    algorithm is controlled by a small number of parameters that can \n    be set by the operator.  The first parameter is the cutoff level.  \n    In determining possible cutoff candidates, the algorithm scans the \n    region highlighted by the operator and records two separate points,\n    one above the cutoff level and one below.  The closer the two points\n    are, temporally, the steeper the slope will be.  Therefore, the \n    operator can change the location of the cutoff level to manipulate \n    where the algorithm looks for cutoffs within the highlighted region\n    of interest.  The next parameter is the slope magnitude, which \n    designates the minimum magnitude of the finite difference slope \n    where the cutoff must reside.  The operator may raise the slope \n    level in order to scan only for sharp cutoffs, or lower it in order\n    to accommodate less steep slopes, depending on the quality of the \n    spectrum data.  When there is more than one possible cutoff, the \n    detection program will display them as cutoff candidates.  The \n    cutoff level, slope magnitude and cutoff candidates are displayed by\n    the program for viewing by the operator.  While the algorithm \n    chooses the lowest frequency cutoff by default, the operator may \n    override the algorithm and choose any of the possible cutoffs to be\n    recorded.\n    \n    While most of the characteristic frequencies are, by definition, \n    the cutoff of propagating wave modes, there are certain \n    circumstances when the characteristic frequency is denoted as the\n    peak of a wave mode in the spectrum.  Because of this, there is an\n    algorithm specifically for resonance or peak detection.  Many \n    spectra of interest to this study include Z-mode radiation, which \n    has a low-frequency cutoff at fL=0.  Barbosa et al. \n    [BARBOSAETAL1990B] demonstrated that taking the peak of the Z-mode\n    as fL=0 yields the highest consistency in the determination of \n    fpe.  Hence, when the Z-mode is enhanced, we utilize the peak \n    detection algorithm to identify fL=0 from which fpe and the \n    electron density can be derived.  This algorithm can also be used \n    to determine fUH when an enhancement at that frequency is present \n    in the spectrum.  In order to measure this resonance or spectral \n    peak, the peak detection algorithm fits a Gaussian curve to the \n    highest peak within the region specified by the program operator.  \n    The algorithm then records the frequency of the Gaussian's peak \n    as the peak frequency in the spectrum.  The algorithm displays \n    the spectrum and a darker line which is the Gaussian.  Because \n    there may be noise which exhibits a large peak in the highlighted \n    spectrum, the spectrum is displayed along with the Gaussian curve \n    and a vertical line designating where the peak was measured.  \n    The operator always has the ability to manually change the peak's \n    location and alter the measurement in such cases.  \n     \n    While the operator utilizes a color spectrogram to guide the cutoff\n    and peak detectors, we emphasize that this is only used as a means\n    of identifying the appropriate range in frequency for the algorithm\n    to search.  The direct use of color spectrograms tends to mislead \n    an operator to perceive a cutoff that is not equivalent to the \n    cutoff in the actual power spectrum [BARBOSAETAL1990B]. Because\n    this may lead to a systematic error in the data, the algorithm \n    utilizes the spectrum itself, and does not depend on a color scale \n    to determine the characteristic frequencies. This should reduce \n    systematic error and lead to more accurate results.\n    \n  Data Coverage\n  =============\n    This data set does not provide complete coverage of the time\n    intervals when Voyager 2 was within Jupiter's magnetosphere.  Two \n    criteria were necessary in order for density measurements to be \n    obtained.  First, wideband waveform data must exist.  These data are\n    waveforms sampled at 4-bit resolution and have a frequency range \n    from 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  1600 samples are collected for 55.56-msec \n    at a rate of 28,800 samples per second, and are then followed by a \n    4.44-msec gap.  These 60-msec intervals make up one line of \n    waveform samples.  The spectrograms then consist of 48-second \n    'frames', consisting of up to 800 lines or 48 seconds each.  Because\n    these data compete with Voyager imaging data for the downlink \n    resource, data is available only a fraction of the time.  Plasma \n    wave spectra data can be either continuous, periodic (such as one \n    48-second frame out of every four such frames), or simply present \n    sporadically.

<pre><code>This data set consists of ASCII formatted plasma wave frequency
and electron plasma density measurements as measured by the Plasma
Waves Science instrument and calculated from the equations of cold 
plasma theory.  These frequency measurements were taken from 
Voyager 2 electric field waveform samples from Voyager 2 Plasma 
Wave Science (PWS) waveform receiver obtained during its Jupiter 
flyby.  The data set includes select measurements from spacecraft
event time (SCET) 1979-07-04T23:44:47.500Z to 
1979-07-11T23:58:22.500Z.  The data are separated into day files
and the individual data points are taken every 1-second.  As will
be explained in more detail below, the frequency measurements and 
therefore the density measurements in this data set are measured 
from high-resolution wideband plasma wave spectra.  To learn more 
about these spectra and their specific submitted volumes, see the 
Related PDS Products section in the AAREADME files found in the 
root directory of this volume. 
</code></pre>
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<pre><code>While the data essential to this volume are the electron plasma
densities, there are a number of other plasma parameters included 
with this data.  The data set consists of ASCII files with one
record per time step, occurring in 1-second increments.  Each
record includes the time, magnetic field strength (obtained from
the Voyager 2 magnetometer), the electron cyclotron frequency (if
available), the frequency of the cutoff or resonance measured, a 
code indicating the name of the frequency measured, the calculated
electron density, and a set of position coordinates for the 
spacecraft at the time of the observation.  Also included in each
record are the electron plasma frequency fpe, extraordinary mode 
cutoff frequency fR=0, ordinary mode cutoff frequency fL=0, upper
hybrid resonance frequency fUH, and a quality index.  One of these
four frequencies is just a copy of the measured cutoff or resonance
frequency while the remaining frequencies are calculated using the
magnetic field data and the equations of cold plasma theory.  
Different files are used for each day.
</code></pre>
<h1>Processing</h1>
<pre><code>The ASCII density data files produced in this volume were derived
from measuring the characteristic frequencies from the local plasma.
The density was calculated from these data, along with cyclotron
frequency data derived from magnetic field data, using the equations
of cold plasma theory. 

In order to measure these characteristic frequencies, this work 
utilizes a new program that allows the operator to highlight the 
general vicinity of the cutoff or resonance on a frequency-time 
spectrogram.  Then, an algorithm finds the cutoff or resonance in 
the region and records the frequency at 1 second intervals.  Hence,
the automated procedure has a high temporal resolution (1 second) 
and requires a relatively low level of both manual effort and
subjective judgment by the operator.

There are two different algorithms used: one for cutoff detection
and one for resonance or peak detection.  The cutoff detection 
algorithm is controlled by a small number of parameters that can 
be set by the operator.  The first parameter is the cutoff level.  
In determining possible cutoff candidates, the algorithm scans the 
region highlighted by the operator and records two separate points,
one above the cutoff level and one below.  The closer the two points
are, temporally, the steeper the slope will be.  Therefore, the 
operator can change the location of the cutoff level to manipulate 
where the algorithm looks for cutoffs within the highlighted region
of interest.  The next parameter is the slope magnitude, which 
designates the minimum magnitude of the finite difference slope 
where the cutoff must reside.  The operator may raise the slope 
level in order to scan only for sharp cutoffs, or lower it in order
to accommodate less steep slopes, depending on the quality of the 
spectrum data.  When there is more than one possible cutoff, the 
detection program will display them as cutoff candidates.  The 
cutoff level, slope magnitude and cutoff candidates are displayed by
the program for viewing by the operator.  While the algorithm 
chooses the lowest frequency cutoff by default, the operator may 
override the algorithm and choose any of the possible cutoffs to be
recorded.

While most of the characteristic frequencies are, by definition, 
the cutoff of propagating wave modes, there are certain 
circumstances when the characteristic frequency is denoted as the
peak of a wave mode in the spectrum.  Because of this, there is an
algorithm specifically for resonance or peak detection.  Many 
spectra of interest to this study include Z-mode radiation, which 
has a low-frequency cutoff at fL=0.  Barbosa et al. 
[BARBOSAETAL1990B] demonstrated that taking the peak of the Z-mode
as fL=0 yields the highest consistency in the determination of 
fpe.  Hence, when the Z-mode is enhanced, we utilize the peak 
detection algorithm to identify fL=0 from which fpe and the 
electron density can be derived.  This algorithm can also be used 
to determine fUH when an enhancement at that frequency is present 
in the spectrum.  In order to measure this resonance or spectral 
peak, the peak detection algorithm fits a Gaussian curve to the 
highest peak within the region specified by the program operator.  
The algorithm then records the frequency of the Gaussian's peak 
as the peak frequency in the spectrum.  The algorithm displays 
the spectrum and a darker line which is the Gaussian.  Because 
there may be noise which exhibits a large peak in the highlighted 
spectrum, the spectrum is displayed along with the Gaussian curve 
and a vertical line designating where the peak was measured.  
The operator always has the ability to manually change the peak's 
location and alter the measurement in such cases.  
 
While the operator utilizes a color spectrogram to guide the cutoff
and peak detectors, we emphasize that this is only used as a means
of identifying the appropriate range in frequency for the algorithm
to search.  The direct use of color spectrograms tends to mislead 
an operator to perceive a cutoff that is not equivalent to the 
cutoff in the actual power spectrum [BARBOSAETAL1990B]. Because
this may lead to a systematic error in the data, the algorithm 
utilizes the spectrum itself, and does not depend on a color scale 
to determine the characteristic frequencies. This should reduce 
systematic error and lead to more accurate results.

<pre><code>This data set consists of ASCII formatted plasma wave frequency
and electron plasma density measurements as measured by the Plasma
Waves Science instrument and calculated from the equations of cold 
plasma theory.  These frequency measurements were taken from 
Voyager 2 electric field waveform samples from Voyager 2 Plasma 
Wave Science (PWS) waveform receiver obtained during its Jupiter 
flyby.  The data set includes select measurements from spacecraft
event time (SCET) 1979-07-04T23:44:47.500Z to 
1979-07-11T23:58:22.500Z.  The data are separated into day files
and the individual data points are taken every 1-second.  As will
be explained in more detail below, the frequency measurements and 
therefore the density measurements in this data set are measured 
from high-resolution wideband plasma wave spectra.  To learn more 
about these spectra and their specific submitted volumes, see the 
Related PDS Products section in the AAREADME files found in the 
root directory of this volume. 
</code></pre>
<h1>Parameters</h1>
<pre><code>While the data essential to this volume are the electron plasma
densities, there are a number of other plasma parameters included 
with this data.  The data set consists of ASCII files with one
record per time step, occurring in 1-second increments.  Each
record includes the time, magnetic field strength (obtained from
the Voyager 2 magnetometer), the electron cyclotron frequency (if
available), the frequency of the cutoff or resonance measured, a 
code indicating the name of the frequency measured, the calculated
electron density, and a set of position coordinates for the 
spacecraft at the time of the observation.  Also included in each
record are the electron plasma frequency fpe, extraordinary mode 
cutoff frequency fR=0, ordinary mode cutoff frequency fL=0, upper
hybrid resonance frequency fUH, and a quality index.  One of these
four frequencies is just a copy of the measured cutoff or resonance
frequency while the remaining frequencies are calculated using the
magnetic field data and the equations of cold plasma theory.  
Different files are used for each day.

<h1>Processing</h1>
<pre><code>The ASCII density data files produced in this volume were derived
from measuring the characteristic frequencies from the local plasma.
The density was calculated from these data, along with cyclotron
frequency data derived from magnetic field data, using the equations
of cold plasma theory. 

In order to measure these characteristic frequencies, this work 
utilizes a new program that allows the operator to highlight the 
general vicinity of the cutoff or resonance on a frequency-time 
spectrogram.  Then, an algorithm finds the cutoff or resonance in 
the region and records the frequency at 1 second intervals.  Hence,
the automated procedure has a high temporal resolution (1 second) 
and requires a relatively low level of both manual effort and
subjective judgment by the operator.

There are two different algorithms used: one for cutoff detection
and one for resonance or peak detection.  The cutoff detection 
algorithm is controlled by a small number of parameters that can 
be set by the operator.  The first parameter is the cutoff level.  
In determining possible cutoff candidates, the algorithm scans the 
region highlighted by the operator and records two separate points,
one above the cutoff level and one below.  The closer the two points
are, temporally, the steeper the slope will be.  Therefore, the 
operator can change the location of the cutoff level to manipulate 
where the algorithm looks for cutoffs within the highlighted region
of interest.  The next parameter is the slope magnitude, which 
designates the minimum magnitude of the finite difference slope 
where the cutoff must reside.  The operator may raise the slope 
level in order to scan only for sharp cutoffs, or lower it in order
to accommodate less steep slopes, depending on the quality of the 
spectrum data.  When there is more than one possible cutoff, the 
detection program will display them as cutoff candidates.  The 
cutoff level, slope magnitude and cutoff candidates are displayed by
the program for viewing by the operator.  While the algorithm 
chooses the lowest frequency cutoff by default, the operator may 
override the algorithm and choose any of the possible cutoffs to be
recorded.

While most of the characteristic frequencies are, by definition, 
the cutoff of propagating wave modes, there are certain 
circumstances when the characteristic frequency is denoted as the
peak of a wave mode in the spectrum.  Because of this, there is an
algorithm specifically for resonance or peak detection.  Many 
spectra of interest to this study include Z-mode radiation, which 
has a low-frequency cutoff at fL=0.  Barbosa et al. 
[BARBOSAETAL1990B] demonstrated that taking the peak of the Z-mode
as fL=0 yields the highest consistency in the determination of 
fpe.  Hence, when the Z-mode is enhanced, we utilize the peak 
detection algorithm to identify fL=0 from which fpe and the 
electron density can be derived.  This algorithm can also be used 
to determine fUH when an enhancement at that frequency is present 
in the spectrum.  In order to measure this resonance or spectral 
peak, the peak detection algorithm fits a Gaussian curve to the 
highest peak within the region specified by the program operator.  
The algorithm then records the frequency of the Gaussian's peak 
as the peak frequency in the spectrum.  The algorithm displays 
the spectrum and a darker line which is the Gaussian.  Because 
there may be noise which exhibits a large peak in the highlighted 
spectrum, the spectrum is displayed along with the Gaussian curve 
and a vertical line designating where the peak was measured.  
The operator always has the ability to manually change the peak's 
location and alter the measurement in such cases.  
 
While the operator utilizes a color spectrogram to guide the cutoff
and peak detectors, we emphasize that this is only used as a means
of identifying the appropriate range in frequency for the algorithm
to search.  The direct use of color spectrograms tends to mislead 
an operator to perceive a cutoff that is not equivalent to the 
cutoff in the actual power spectrum [BARBOSAETAL1990B]. Because
this may lead to a systematic error in the data, the algorithm 
utilizes the spectrum itself, and does not depend on a color scale 
to determine the characteristic frequencies. This should reduce 
systematic error and lead to more accurate results.
