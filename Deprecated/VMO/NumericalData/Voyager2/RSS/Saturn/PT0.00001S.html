The data have been reduced to give profiles   \n      of temperature and pressure as a function of height in the      \n      atmosphere [LINDALETAL1985] and to infer magnetic field         \n      orientations in the upper ionosphere [HINSON1984].              \n                                                                      \n      During the Saturn occultation, the Voyager 2 spacecraft         \n      provided a coherent, dual-frequency microwave radio signal      \n      source.  The signal frequency was derived from a precision,     \n      onboard Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The spacecraft          \n      high-gain antenna (HGA) beamed that signal through the          \n      atmosphere and rings of Saturn.  As the spacecraft moved on     \n      its trajectory, the radio signal probed the atmosphere and      \n      rings at different radial positions from the center of mass.    \n      An hour later the signals were received using a 64-meter        \n      antenna of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) near Canberra      \n      (Australia).                                                    \n                                                                      \n      To keep the refracted radio beam aimed toward the DSN antenna   \n      during the atmospheric occultation, the spacecraft attitude     \n      was adjusted so that the high-gain antenna (HGA) was pointed    \n      at the virtual image of Earth on Saturn's limb.  This ensured   \n      that maximum signal strength would be available from the        \n      deepest probing.  During the deepest part of the atmospheric    \n      occultation, the HGA was pointed toward the rings to determine  \n      whether signals forward scattered by the ring particles could   \n      be detected on Earth.                                           \n                                                                      \n      Related data sets of possible interest include:                 \n                                                                      \n                DATA_SET_ID                Description                \n         -----------------------  --------------------------------    \n         VG1-SSA-RSS-1-ROCC-V1.0  Titan radio occultation raw data    \n         VG1-S-RSS-1-REDR-V1.0*   Saturn Voyager 1 ingress radio      \n                                     occultation raw data             \n         VG1-S-RSS-1-ROCC-V1.0    Saturn Voyager 1 egress radio       \n                                     occultation and ring             \n                                     scattering raw data              \n               *tentative DATA_SET_ID assignment                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    Parameters                                                        \n    ==========                                                        \n      The output of each S-band receiver was a sinusoidal carrier     \n      signal embedded in noise -- a voltage with bandwidth            \n      approximately 50 kHz and sampled at 300000 samples per second.  \n      The X-band receiver output was similar; but, because of greater \n      potential for Doppler drift and prediction uncertainty, its     \n      bandwidth was 150 kHz and sampling rate was 300000 samples per  \n      second.  Voltages typically were in the range +/- 10 volts;     \n      but the absolute levels were not calibrated.  In fact, they     \n      are generally not needed since it is the frequency (or phase)   \n      of the signal (rather than amplitude) that is most useful in    \n      inferring properties of a neutral atmosphere or ionosphere,     \n      and amplitude calibration for ring observations can be          \n      obtained by referencing signals to the background radiothermal  \n      noise in the data stream.                                       \n                                                                      \n      The frequency of the USO was known from monitoring during the   \n      Jupiter-Saturn cruise (and from post-Saturn observations).      \n      Doppler contributions from motions of the spacecraft, Earth,    \n      Saturn, and other bodies of the solar system were determined    \n      jointly with the Voyager Navigation Team.  Relativistic         \n      Doppler contributions could be estimated from proximity to      \n      large masses.  Receiver tuning was recorded in POCA             \n      (Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly) files, which are     \n      included with this archive.                                     \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    Processing                                                        \n    ==========                                                        \n      No processing per se has been carried out on these data.        \n      However, because of the high sampling rate, the 8-bit samples   \n      were recorded originally on wide-bandwidth analog video tape.   \n      The analog tapes were then replayed later at slower speeds and  \n      the digital data were extracted onto computer compatible tapes  \n      (CCTs) with each receiver channel on a separate set of tapes.   \n      Because the S-band data had been oversampled originally         \n      (300 ksps for a 50 kHz bandwidth), only one of every three      \n      samples was saved during the transfer of S-band data to CCTs.   \n      This process, known as 'decimation', meant that 300 seconds     \n      of data could be stored on an S-band CCT whereas only           \n      100 seconds of X-band data would fit.                           \n                                                                      \n      Because analog recording technology was required to save the    \n      high data rate digital samples, there are occasional dropouts   \n      in the sample stream.  These can be detected by paying special  \n      attention to counter fields in data record headers.             \n                                                                      \n      Two analog recorders (A and B) were available at each DSN       \n      complex.   Because a single recorder could not capture the      \n      entire set of Saturn occultation activities, the two were run   \n      in parallel with staggered start/stop times.  Most data were    \n      collected using Recorder A; but Recorder B was used to          \n      capture the samples while Recorder A was being reloaded.        \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n    Data                                                              \n    ====                                                              \n      Primary data were delivered to Voyager Radio Science Team       \n      members in the form of 30 megabyte (MB) CCTs covering           \n      300 s (S-band) or 100 s (X-band).

================<br>
This data set consists of raw data collected during the Saturn<br>
radio occultation of Voyager 2 on 26 August 1981, ring<br>
scattering data collected during the same time period, test<br>
and calibration data collected about 8 hours earlier, and<br>
ancillary files that might be useful in analysis of those data.<br>
The raw data are sampled voltage outputs from receivers tuned to<br>
the Voyager carrier frequencies at both S-band and X-band during<br>
the occultation.  The data have been reduced to give profiles<br>
of temperature and pressure as a function of height in the<br>
atmosphere [LINDALETAL1985] and to infer magnetic field<br>
orientations in the upper ionosphere [HINSON1984].</p>
<pre><code>  During the Saturn occultation, the Voyager 2 spacecraft         
  provided a coherent, dual-frequency microwave radio signal      
  source.  The signal frequency was derived from a precision,     
  onboard Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO).  The spacecraft          
  high-gain antenna (HGA) beamed that signal through the          
  atmosphere and rings of Saturn.  As the spacecraft moved on     
  its trajectory, the radio signal probed the atmosphere and      
  rings at different radial positions from the center of mass.    
  An hour later the signals were received using a 64-meter        
  antenna of the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) near Canberra      
  (Australia).                                                    
                                                                  
  To keep the refracted radio beam aimed toward the DSN antenna   
  during the atmospheric occultation, the spacecraft attitude     
  was adjusted so that the high-gain antenna (HGA) was pointed    
  at the virtual image of Earth on Saturn's limb.  This ensured   
  that maximum signal strength would be available from the        
  deepest probing.  During the deepest part of the atmospheric    
  occultation, the HGA was pointed toward the rings to determine  
  whether signals forward scattered by the ring particles could   
  be detected on Earth.

Parameters                                                        
==========                                                        
  The output of each S-band receiver was a sinusoidal carrier     
  signal embedded in noise -- a voltage with bandwidth            
  approximately 50 kHz and sampled at 300000 samples per second.  
  The X-band receiver output was similar; but, because of greater 
  potential for Doppler drift and prediction uncertainty, its     
  bandwidth was 150 kHz and sampling rate was 300000 samples per  
  second.  Voltages typically were in the range +/- 10 volts;     
  but the absolute levels were not calibrated.  In fact, they     
  are generally not needed since it is the frequency (or phase)   
  of the signal (rather than amplitude) that is most useful in    
  inferring properties of a neutral atmosphere or ionosphere,     
  and amplitude calibration for ring observations can be          
  obtained by referencing signals to the background radiothermal  
  noise in the data stream.                                       
                                                                  
  The frequency of the USO was known from monitoring during the   
  Jupiter-Saturn cruise (and from post-Saturn observations).      
  Doppler contributions from motions of the spacecraft, Earth,    
  Saturn, and other bodies of the solar system were determined    
  jointly with the Voyager Navigation Team.  Relativistic         
  Doppler contributions could be estimated from proximity to      
  large masses.  Receiver tuning was recorded in POCA             
  (Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly) files, which are     
  included with this archive.                                     
                                                                  
                                                                  
Processing                                                        
==========                                                        
  No processing per se has been carried out on these data.        
  However, because of the high sampling rate, the 8-bit samples   
  were recorded originally on wide-bandwidth analog video tape.   
  The analog tapes were then replayed later at slower speeds and  
  the digital data were extracted onto computer compatible tapes  
  (CCTs) with each receiver channel on a separate set of tapes.   
  Because the S-band data had been oversampled originally         
  (300 ksps for a 50 kHz bandwidth), only one of every three      
  samples was saved during the transfer of S-band data to CCTs.   
  This process, known as 'decimation', meant that 300 seconds     
  of data could be stored on an S-band CCT whereas only           
  100 seconds of X-band data would fit.                           
                                                                  
  Because analog recording technology was required to save the    
  high data rate digital samples, there are occasional dropouts   
  in the sample stream.  These can be detected by paying special  
  attention to counter fields in data record headers.             
                                                                  
  Two analog recorders (A and B) were available at each DSN       
  complex.   Because a single recorder could not capture the      
  entire set of Saturn occultation activities, the two were run   
  in parallel with staggered start/stop times.  Most data were    
  collected using Recorder A; but Recorder B was used to          
  capture the samples while Recorder A was being reloaded.        
                                                                  
                                                                  
Data                                                              
====                                                              
  Primary data were delivered to Voyager Radio Science Team       
  members in the form of 30 megabyte (MB) CCTs covering           
  300 s (S-band) or 100 s (X-band).  Each tape had  6000          
  records of 5056 bytes (56 bytes of header information           
  and 5000 8-bit samples of receiver output voltage).  Tapes      
  were numbered s</code></pre>

  The output of each S-band receiver was a sinusoidal carrier     
  signal embedded in noise -- a voltage with bandwidth            
  approximately 50 kHz and sampled at 300000 samples per second.  
  The X-band receiver output was similar; but, because of greater 
  potential for Doppler drift and prediction uncertainty, its     
  bandwidth was 150 kHz and sampling rate was 300000 samples per  
  second.  Voltages typically were in the range +/- 10 volts;     
  but the absolute levels were not calibrated.  In fact, they     
  are generally not needed since it is the frequency (or phase)   
  of the signal (rather than amplitude) that is most useful in    
  inferring properties of a neutral atmosphere or ionosphere,     
  and amplitude calibration for ring observations can be          
  obtained by referencing signals to the background radiothermal  
  noise in the data stream.                                       
                                                                  
  The frequency of the USO was known from monitoring during the   
  Jupiter-Saturn cruise (and from post-Saturn observations).      
  Doppler contributions from motions of the spacecraft, Earth,    
  Saturn, and other bodies of the solar system were determined    
  jointly with the Voyager Navigation Team.  Relativistic         
  Doppler contributions could be estimated from proximity to      
  large masses.  Receiver tuning was recorded in POCA             
  (Programmable Oscillator Control Assembly) files, which are     
  included with this archive.                                     
                                                                  
                                                                  
Processing                                                        
==========                                                        
  No processing per se has been carried out on these data.        
  However, because of the high sampling rate, the 8-bit samples   
  were recorded originally on wide-bandwidth analog video tape.   
  The analog tapes were then replayed later at slower speeds and  
  the digital data were extracted onto computer compatible tapes  
  (CCTs) with each receiver channel on a separate set of tapes.   
  Because the S-band data had been oversampled originally         
  (300 ksps for a 50 kHz bandwidth), only one of every three      
  samples was saved during the transfer of S-band data to CCTs.   
  This process, known as 'decimation', meant that 300 seconds     
  of data could be stored on an S-band CCT whereas only           
  100 seconds of X-band data would fit.                           
                                                                  
  Because analog recording technology was required to save the    
  high data rate digital samples, there are occasional dropouts   
  in the sample stream.  These can be detected by paying special  
  attention to counter fields in data record headers.             
                                                                  
  Two analog recorders (A and B) were available at each DSN       
  complex.   Because a single recorder could not capture the      
  entire set of Saturn occultation activities, the two were run   
  in parallel with staggered start/stop times.  Most data were    
  collected using Recorder A; but Recorder B was used to          
  capture the samples while Recorder A was being reloaded.

  Primary data were delivered to Voyager Radio Science Team       
  members in the form of 30 megabyte (MB) CCTs covering           
  300 s (S-band) or 100 s (X-band).  Each tape had  6000          
  records of 5056 bytes (56 bytes of header information           
  and 5000 8-bit samples of receiver output voltage).  Tapes      
  were numbered s</code></pre>
