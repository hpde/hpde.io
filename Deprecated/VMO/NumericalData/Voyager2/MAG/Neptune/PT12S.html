<pre><code>The Voyager magnetometer investigation (P.I.- Norman F. Ness) makes       
available archival data through the National Space Science Data Center    
(NSSDC) located at NASA/GSFC as well as through the Planetary Data System 
(PDS) and other channels. The primary archive format, referred to as a    
'summary tape' or 'conjoint summary tape' has been used consistently      
since the beginning of the Voyager mission to the outer planets (1977).   
This format makes available magnetometer observations, supplementary      
engineering and ephemeris data in one data file, and it is one product    
of Voyager magnetometer routine data processing. Users are referred to    
the summary format data for all data requirements with one exception:     
Neptune encounter high field observations. Neptune close approach         
observations are archived separately and in a different format from       
that with which many are familiar. This high-field archive is             
described here.                                                           
                                                                          
The special demands of the Neptune encounter flyby exceeded (finally)     
the capabilities of the routine data processing system conceived and      
implemented in the mid 1970's. As a result, it was necessary to implement 
an additional data processing system with which the near-encounter, high  
field magnetometer observations were processed. The data products avail-  
able with this new data processing system are not available in the same   
format as the standard Voyager magnetometer observations; thus the need   
for a separate archive and a new format description. We appreciate the    
desirability of a consistent archive format, but find no reasonable       
alternative to the present solution. We expect, however, that users       
interested in near encounter observations will find this new format both  
useful and easy to assimilate.                                            
                                                                          
The magnetic fields investigation on Voyager carries a total of four      
tri-axial ring core fluxgate magnetometers: two identical high field      
magnetometers mounted on the spacecraft body (HFM's) and two identical    
low field magnetometers (LFM's) arranged on a 13 m boom (Behannon et      
al., 1977). The two LFM's automatically step through a total of eight     
dynamic ranges (ranges 0 through 7) in response to changes in the         
measured field, starting with a nominal dynamic range of  8 nT, and       
increasing to a nominal dynamic range of  50,000 nT. The two HFM's each   
operate in two dynamic ranges (ranges 0 and 1) with nominal values of     
50,000 nT and  200,000 nT. In the Neptune encounter mode, each            
magnetometer was sampled periodically with a temporal resolution of       
between 0.600 s and 0.060 s, and analog-to-digital converted with 12 bit  
resolution for subsequent telemetry. The magnitude of the maximum         
observed field at Neptune (approximately 10,000 nT) was sufficiently      
large that data from all four of the magnetometers proved useful.

<pre><code>The vector magnetic field is rendered in a right handed spherical         
coordinate system in which the angles THETA and PHI are the usual         
polar angles, with THETA (colatitude) measured from the axis of

orientation of Neptune's pole is specified by a right ascension           
of 298.90 and declination of 42.84 at the time of the encounter, as       
given in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's distribution of physical         
constants dated 11/06/89. Planetary longitudes are based on a             
16.11 hour rotation period (Warwick et al., 1989) adopted by the          
Voyager Project shortly after the encounter. The zero longitude is        
defined by the requirement that the West Longitude of the spacecraft      
at 0356 SCET day 237 (near closest approach) be 167.7 NLS; West           
Longitudes of the Neptune Longitude System (NLS) are simply related

<pre><code>The Voyager magnetometer investigation (P.I.- Norman F. Ness) makes       
available archival data through the National Space Science Data Center    
(NSSDC) located at NASA/GSFC as well as through the Planetary Data System 
(PDS) and other channels. The primary archive format, referred to as a    
'summary tape' or 'conjoint summary tape' has been used consistently      
since the beginning of the Voyager mission to the outer planets (1977).   
This format makes available magnetometer observations, supplementary      
engineering and ephemeris data in one data file, and it is one product    
of Voyager magnetometer routine data processing. Users are referred to    
the summary format data for all data requirements with one exception:     
Neptune encounter high field observations. Neptune close approach         
observations are archived separately and in a different format from       
that with which many are familiar. This high-field archive is             
described here.                                                           
                                                                          
The special demands of the Neptune encounter flyby exceeded (finally)     
the capabilities of the routine data processing system conceived and      
implemented in the mid 1970's. As a result, it was necessary to implement 
an additional data processing system with which the near-encounter, high  
field magnetometer observations were processed. The data products avail-  
able with this new data processing system are not available in the same   
format as the standard Voyager magnetometer observations; thus the need   
for a separate archive and a new format description. We appreciate the    
desirability of a consistent archive format, but find no reasonable       
alternative to the present solution. We expect, however, that users       
interested in near encounter observations will find this new format both  
useful and easy to assimilate.                                            
                                                                          
The magnetic fields investigation on Voyager carries a total of four      
tri-axial ring core fluxgate magnetometers: two identical high field      
magnetometers mounted on the spacecraft body (HFM's) and two identical    
low field magnetometers (LFM's) arranged on a 13 m boom (Behannon et      
al., 1977). The two LFM's automatically step through a total of eight     
dynamic ranges (ranges 0 through 7) in response to changes in the         
measured field, starting with a nominal dynamic range of  8 nT, and       
increasing to a nominal dynamic range of  50,000 nT. The two HFM's each   
operate in two dynamic ranges (ranges 0 and 1) with nominal values of     
50,000 nT and  200,000 nT. In the Neptune encounter mode, each            
magnetometer was sampled periodically with a temporal resolution of       
between 0.600 s and 0.060 s, and analog-to-digital converted with 12 bit  
resolution for subsequent telemetry. The magnitude of the maximum         
observed field at Neptune (approximately 10,000 nT) was sufficiently      
large that data from all four of the magnetometers proved useful.

<h1>Data</h1>
<ol>

</ol>
<p>ctime - Decimal seconds past 1966-01-02T00:00:00 (an internal time format)<br>
SCET  - Spacecraft event time PDS/ISO standard time format.<br>
B_R - Magnetic field vector radial component in units of nanotesla;<br>
planetocentric right-handed spherical coordinate system.<br>
B_THETA - Magnetic field vector theta component, units nanotesla.<br>
B_PHI - Magnetic field vector phi component, units nanotesla.</p>
<pre><code>The vector magnetic field is rendered in a right handed spherical         
coordinate system in which the angles THETA and PHI are the usual         
polar angles, with THETA (colatitude) measured from the axis of           
rotation and PHI increasing in the direction of rotation. The             
orientation of Neptune's pole is specified by a right ascension           
of 298.90 and declination of 42.84 at the time of the encounter, as       
given in the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's distribution of physical         
constants dated 11/06/89. Planetary longitudes are based on a             
16.11 hour rotation period (Warwick et al., 1989) adopted by the          
Voyager Project shortly after the encounter. The zero longitude is        
defined by the requirement that the West Longitude of the spacecraft      
at 0356 SCET day 237 (near closest approach) be 167.7 NLS; West           
Longitudes of the Neptune Longitude System (NLS) are simply related       
to the angle PHI:                                                         
                                                                          
                  WLONG = 360. - PHI   (degrees)
