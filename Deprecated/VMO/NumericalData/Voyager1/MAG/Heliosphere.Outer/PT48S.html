These files consist of a set of averages      \n      applied across all of the mission's differing telemetry modes.  In the  \n      case of the Magnetometer Experiment, the records contain both           \n      1.92 second, 9.6 second and 48 second averages.  1.92 second averages   \n      are created from the detail detail data, 9.6 second averages are created\n      from 1.92 second averages and 48 second averages are created from the   \n      9.6 second averages.                                                    \n                                                                              \n      All data in this NSSDC data set are interplanetary and in heliographic  \n      coordinates (see below). An ASCII formated data set containing key      \n      components of the 48 second magnetic field data and ephemeris data has  \n      been created allowing more convenient access to high resolution Voyager \n      magnetometer data.                                                      \n                                                                              \n    Coordinate System                                                         \n    =================                                                         \n                                                                              \n      Interplanetary magnetic field studies make use of two important         \n      coordinate systems, the Inertial Heliographic (IHG) coordinate system   \n      and the Heliographic (HG) coordinate system.                            \n                                                                              \n      The IHG coordinate system is use to define the spacecraft's position.   \n      The IHG system is defined with its origin at the Sun.  There are three  \n      orthogonal axes, X(IHG), Y(IHG), and Z(IHG).  The Z(IHG) axis points    \n      northward along the Sun's spin axis.  The X(IHG) - Y(IHG) plane lays in \n      the solar equatorial plane.  The intersection of the solar equatorial   \n      plane with the ecliptic plane defines a line, the longitude of the      \n      ascending node, which is taken to be the X(IHG) axis.  The X(IHG) axis  \n      drifts slowly with time, approximately one degree per 72 years.         \n                                                                              \n      Magnetic field orientation is defined in relation to the spacecraft.    \n      Drawing a line from the Sun's center (IHG origin) to the spacecraft     \n      defines the X axis of the HG coordinate system.  The HG coordinate      \n      system is defined with its origin centered at the spacecraft.  Three    \n      orthogonal axes are defined, X(HG), Y(HG), and Z(HG).  The X(HG) axis   \n      points radially away from the Sun and the Y(HG) axis is parallel to the \n      solar equatorial plane and therefore parallel to the X(IHG)-Y(IHG) plane\n      too.  The Z(HG) axis is chosen to complete the orthonormal triad.       \n                                                                              \n      An excellent reference guide with diagrams explaining the IHG and HG    \n      systems may be found in Space and Science Reviews, Volume 39 (1984),    \n      pages 255-316, MHD Processes in the Outer Heliosphere, L.

=================</p>
<pre><code>  This dataset contains Voyager 1 magnetometer data from the              
  interplanetary cruise averaged to 48 second samples in Heliographic     
  coordinates.                                                            
                                                                          
Data Processing                                                           
===============                                                           
  The high resolution data submitted to the NSSDC has its origins in the  
  original MVS 'Summary' data sets formally produced on the NSSC IBM MVS  
  mainframe system.  The original data sets contain a mix of engineering, 
  electron, magnetic field and plasma data.  The Voyager magnetometer     
  (MAG) experiment now resides on a dedicated workstation where only MAG  
  data are processed.                                                     
                                                                          
  All Voyager MAG data submitted to the NSSDC consists wholly of high     
  resolution LFM averages.  These files consist of a set of averages      
  applied across all of the mission's differing telemetry modes.  In the  
  case of the Magnetometer Experiment, the records contain both           
  1.92 second, 9.6 second and 48 second averages.  1.92 second averages   
  are created from the detail detail data, 9.6 second averages are created
  from 1.92 second averages and 48 second averages are created from the   
  9.6 second averages.                                                    
                                                                          
  All data in this NSSDC data set are interplanetary and in heliographic  
  coordinates (see below). An ASCII formated data set containing key      
  components of the 48 second magnetic field data and ephemeris data has  
  been created allowing more convenient access to high resolution Voyager 
  magnetometer data.                                                      
                                                                          
Coordinate System                                                         
=================                                                         
                                                                          
  Interplanetary magnetic field studies make use of two important         
  coordinate systems, the Inertial Heliographic (IHG) coordinate system   
  and the Heliographic (HG) coordinate system.                            
                                                                          
  The IHG coordinate system is use to define the spacecraft's position.   
  The IHG system is defined with its origin at the Sun.  There are three  
  orthogonal axes, X(IHG), Y(IHG), and Z(IHG).  The Z(IHG) axis points    
  northward along the Sun's spin axis.  The X(IHG) - Y(IHG) plane lays in 
  the solar equatorial plane.  The intersection of the solar equatorial   
  plane with the ecliptic plane defines a line, the longitude of the      
  ascending node, which is taken to be the X(IHG) axis.  The X(IHG) axis  
  drifts slowly with time, approximately one degree per 72 years.         
                                                                          
  Magnetic field orientation is defined in relation to the spacecraft.    
  Drawing a line from the Sun's center (IHG origin) to the spacecraft     
  defines the X axis of the HG coordinate system.  The HG coordinate      
  system is defined with its origin centered at the spacecraft.  Three    
  orthogonal axes are defined, X(HG), Y(HG), and Z(HG).  The X(HG) axis   
  points radially away from the Sun and the Y(HG) axis is parallel to the 
  solar equatorial plane and therefore parallel to the X(IHG)-Y(IHG) plane
  too.  The Z(HG) axis is chosen to complete the orthonormal triad.       
                                                                          
  An excellent reference guide with diagrams explaining the IHG and HG    
  systems may be found in Space and Science Reviews, Volume 39 (1984),

=================</p>
<pre><code>  This dataset contains Voyager 1 magnetometer data from the              
  interplanetary cruise averaged to 48 second samples in Heliographic     
  coordinates.                                                            
                                                                          
Data Processing                                                           
===============                                                           
  The high resolution data submitted to the NSSDC has its origins in the  
  original MVS 'Summary' data sets formally produced on the NSSC IBM MVS  
  mainframe system.  The original data sets contain a mix of engineering, 
  electron, magnetic field and plasma data.  The Voyager magnetometer     
  (MAG) experiment now resides on a dedicated workstation where only MAG  
  data are processed.                                                     
                                                                          
  All Voyager MAG data submitted to the NSSDC consists wholly of high     
  resolution LFM averages.  These files consist of a set of averages      
  applied across all of the mission's differing telemetry modes.  In the  
  case of the Magnetometer Experiment, the records contain both           
  1.92 second, 9.6 second and 48 second averages.  1.92 second averages   
  are created from the detail detail data, 9.6 second averages are created
  from 1.92 second averages and 48 second averages are created from the   
  9.6 second averages.                                                    
                                                                          
  All data in this NSSDC data set are interplanetary and in heliographic  
  coordinates (see below). An ASCII formated data set containing key      
  components of the 48 second magnetic field data and ephemeris data has  
  been created allowing more convenient access to high resolution Voyager 
  magnetometer data.                                                      
                                                                          
Coordinate System                                                         
=================                                                         
                                                                          
  Interplanetary magnetic field studies make use of two important         
  coordinate systems, the Inertial Heliographic (IHG) coordinate system   
  and the Heliographic (HG) coordinate system.                            
                                                                          
  The IHG coordinate system is use to define the spacecraft's position.   
  The IHG system is defined with its origin at the Sun.  There are three  
  orthogonal axes, X(IHG), Y(IHG), and Z(IHG).  The Z(IHG) axis points    
  northward along the Sun's spin axis.  The X(IHG) - Y(IHG) plane lays in 
  the solar equatorial plane.  The intersection of the solar equatorial   
  plane with the ecliptic plane defines a line, the longitude of the      
  ascending node, which is taken to be the X(IHG) axis.  The X(IHG) axis  
  drifts slowly with time, approximately one degree per 72 years.         
                                                                          
  Magnetic field orientation is defined in relation to the spacecraft.    
  Drawing a line from the Sun's center (IHG origin) to the spacecraft     
  defines the X axis of the HG coordinate system.  The HG coordinate      
  system is defined with its origin centered at the spacecraft.  Three    
  orthogonal axes are defined, X(HG), Y(HG), and Z(HG).  The X(HG) axis   
  points radially away from the Sun and the Y(HG) axis is parallel to the 
  solar equatorial plane and therefore parallel to the X(IHG)-Y(IHG) plane
  too.  The Z(HG) axis is chosen to complete the orthonormal triad.

  systems may be found in Space and Science Reviews, Volume 39 (1984),
