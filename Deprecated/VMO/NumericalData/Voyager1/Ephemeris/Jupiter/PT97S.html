Two versions, both covering the same time                \n    period, but containing slightly different data, are provided.            \n    One version was generated by the Voyager MAG team from Voyager           \n    1 SEDR, the other by the PDS/PPI node using the VG1_JUP.BSP and          \n    PCK00003.TPC SPICE kernels.                                              \n                                                                             \n    Two versions of the spacecraft ephemeris data are provided as            \n    an attempt to correct some of the problems in the Voyager SEDR           \n    while preserving the ability to reproduce early results.  The            \n    original SEDR data has a variety of problems which may affect            \n    the knowledge of the spacecraft position, or conversely, the             \n    timing associated with certain events such as ring plane                 \n    crossings.  The SPICE SPK kernel provided on this disk includes          \n    corrections to some, but not all, of the problems associated             \n    with the Voyager SEDR.

Since the Voyager era, there have been           \n    updates to the orientation of the jovian spin axis right                 \n    ascension and declination, the radius of Jupiter, as well as             \n    the orbital characteristic and other physical parameters of              \n    many of the moons of Jupiter.  These changes affect the stated           \n    position of the spacecraft in jovigraphic coordinate systems             \n    like System III without changing the position of the spacecraft          \n    in inertial space.  The spin rate of Jupiter is not changed              \n    from the System III (1965) rate of 9h 55m 29.71sec (870.536              \n    deg/day).

<pre><code>This data set consists of Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter ephemeris          
data in Heliographic coordinates covering the period 1979-02-26          
to 1979-03-24.  Two versions, both covering the same time                
period, but containing slightly different data, are provided.            
One version was generated by the Voyager MAG team from Voyager           
1 SEDR, the other by the PDS/PPI node using the VG1_JUP.BSP and          
PCK00003.TPC SPICE kernels.                                              
                                                                         
Two versions of the spacecraft ephemeris data are provided as            
an attempt to correct some of the problems in the Voyager SEDR           
while preserving the ability to reproduce early results.  The            
original SEDR data has a variety of problems which may affect            
the knowledge of the spacecraft position, or conversely, the             
timing associated with certain events such as ring plane                 
crossings.  The SPICE SPK kernel provided on this disk includes          
corrections to some, but not all, of the problems associated             
with the Voyager SEDR.  The Navigation and Ancillary                     
Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL may issue a new Voyager SPK           
kernel in the future that will further improve the knowledge of          
the spacecraft location in inertial space.                               
                                                                         
There are other differences in the in the two versions of                
ephemeris data that are the result of improvements in the                
knowledge of some of the physical constants associated with              
Jupiter and its moons.  Since the Voyager era, there have been           
updates to the orientation of the jovian spin axis right                 
ascension and declination, the radius of Jupiter, as well as             
the orbital characteristic and other physical parameters of              
many of the moons of Jupiter.  These changes affect the stated           
position of the spacecraft in jovigraphic coordinate systems             
like System III without changing the position of the spacecraft          
in inertial space.  The spin rate of Jupiter is not changed              
from the System III (1965) rate of 9h 55m 29.71sec (870.536              
deg/day).  The SPICE planetary constants kernel (PCK) contains           
both the current IAU definitions of the physical constants for           
the bodies within in the jovian system (as data) as well as the          
older IAU definitions (as comments).  This is an ASCII text              
file (PCK00003.TCP) and users of the ephemeris data are                  
encouraged to review it.

<pre><code>This data set consists of Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter ephemeris          
data in Heliographic coordinates covering the period 1979-02-26          
to 1979-03-24.  Two versions, both covering the same time                
period, but containing slightly different data, are provided.            
One version was generated by the Voyager MAG team from Voyager           
1 SEDR, the other by the PDS/PPI node using the VG1_JUP.BSP and          
PCK00003.TPC SPICE kernels.                                              
                                                                         
Two versions of the spacecraft ephemeris data are provided as            
an attempt to correct some of the problems in the Voyager SEDR           
while preserving the ability to reproduce early results.  The            
original SEDR data has a variety of problems which may affect            
the knowledge of the spacecraft position, or conversely, the             
timing associated with certain events such as ring plane                 
crossings.  The SPICE SPK kernel provided on this disk includes          
corrections to some, but not all, of the problems associated             
with the Voyager SEDR.  The Navigation and Ancillary                     
Information Facility (NAIF) at JPL may issue a new Voyager SPK           
kernel in the future that will further improve the knowledge of          
the spacecraft location in inertial space.                               
                                                                         
There are other differences in the in the two versions of                
ephemeris data that are the result of improvements in the                
knowledge of some of the physical constants associated with              
Jupiter and its moons.  Since the Voyager era, there have been           
updates to the orientation of the jovian spin axis right                 
ascension and declination, the radius of Jupiter, as well as             
the orbital characteristic and other physical parameters of              
many of the moons of Jupiter.  These changes affect the stated           
position of the spacecraft in jovigraphic coordinate systems             
like System III without changing the position of the spacecraft          
in inertial space.  The spin rate of Jupiter is not changed              
from the System III (1965) rate of 9h 55m 29.71sec (870.536              
deg/day).  The SPICE planetary constants kernel (PCK) contains           
both the current IAU definitions of the physical constants for           
the bodies within in the jovian system (as data) as well as the          
older IAU definitions (as comments).  This is an ASCII text              
file (PCK00003.TCP) and users of the ephemeris data are                  
encouraged to review it.
