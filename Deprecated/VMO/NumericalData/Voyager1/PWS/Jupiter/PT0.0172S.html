For each time               \n    interval, a field strength is determined for each of the 16               \n    spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10         \n    Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in           \n    frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated with            \n    each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning        \n    of the scan.  The time between spectra in this data set vary by           \n    telemetry mode and range from 4 seconds to 96 seconds.  During            \n    data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries exist in         \n    the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any          \n    other way.  When one or more channels are missing within a scan,          \n    the missing measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not        \n    calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in          \n    raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they          \n    are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field                 \n    strength.  Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use         \n    with this data set; the use of these is described below.                  \n                                                                              \n    For the cruise data sets, the timing of samples is dependent upon         \n    the spacecraft telemetry mode.  In principle, one can determine           \n    the temporal resolution between spectra simply by noting the              \n    difference in time between two records in the files.  In some             \n    studies, more precise timing information is necessary.  Here, we          \n    describe the timing of the samples for the PWS low rate data as a         \n    function of telemetry mode.                                               \n                                                                              \n    The PWS instrument uses two logarithmic compressors as detectors          \n    for the 16-channel spectrum analyzer, one for the bottom (lower           \n    frequency) 8 channels, and one for the upper (higher frequency) 8         \n    channels.  For each bank of 8 channels, the compressor                    \n    sequentially steps from the lowest frequency of the 8 to the              \n    highest in a regular time step to obtain a complete spectrum.  At         \n    each time step, the higher frequency channel is sampled 1/8 s             \n    prior to the lower frequency channel so that the channels are             \n    sampled in the following order with channel 1 being the lowest            \n    frequency channel (10 Hz) and 16 being the highest (56.2 kHz): 9,         \n    1, 10, 2, 11, 3, ...  15, 7, 16, 8.  The primary difference               \n    between the various data modes is the stepping rate from one              \n    channel to the next (ranging from 0.5 to 12 s, corresponding to           \n    temporal resolutions between complete spectra of 4 s to 96 s).            \n                                                                              \n    In the following table, we present the hexadecimal id for the             \n    various telemetry modes, the mode mnemonic ID, the time between           \n    frequency steps, and the time between complete spectra.  We also          \n    provide the offset from the beginning of the instrument cycle (one        \n    complete spectrum) identified as the time of each record's time           \n    tag to the time of the sampling for the first high-frequency              \n    channel (channel 9) and for the first low-frequency channel               \n    (channel 1).                                                              \n                                                                              \n                                    Time                                      \n                        Frequency   Between      High Freq.

For each bank of 8 channels, the compressor                    \n    sequentially steps from the lowest frequency of the 8 to the              \n    highest in a regular time step to obtain a complete spectrum.  At         \n    each time step, the higher frequency channel is sampled 1/8 s             \n    prior to the lower frequency channel so that the channels are             \n    sampled in the following order with channel 1 being the lowest            \n    frequency channel (10 Hz) and 16 being the highest (56.2 kHz): 9,         \n    1, 10, 2, 11, 3, ...  15, 7, 16, 8.  The primary difference               \n    between the various data modes is the stepping rate from one              \n    channel to the next (ranging from 0.5 to 12 s, corresponding to           \n    temporal resolutions between complete spectra of 4 s to 96 s).            \n                                                                              \n    In the following table, we present the hexadecimal id for the             \n    various telemetry modes, the mode mnemonic ID, the time between           \n    frequency steps, and the time between complete spectra.

<pre><code>This data set consists of electric field spectrum analyzer data           
from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Subsystem obtained during the              
entire mission.  Data after 2013-12-31 will be added to the archive
on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum             
analyzer observations obtained in the cruise mission phases               
before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases

<h1>Data Sampling</h1>
<pre><code>This data set consists of full resolution edited, wave electric           
field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum        
analyzer obtained during the entire mission.  For each time               
interval, a field strength is determined for each of the 16               
spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10         
Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in           
frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated with            
each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning        
of the scan.  The time between spectra in this data set vary by           
telemetry mode and range from 4 seconds to 96 seconds.  During            
data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries exist in         
the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any          
other way.  When one or more channels are missing within a scan,          
the missing measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not        
calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in          
raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they          
are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field                 
strength.  Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use         
with this data set; the use of these is described below.                  
                                                                          
For the cruise data sets, the timing of samples is dependent upon         
the spacecraft telemetry mode.  In principle, one can determine           
the temporal resolution between spectra simply by noting the              
difference in time between two records in the files.  In some             
studies, more precise timing information is necessary.  Here, we          
describe the timing of the samples for the PWS low rate data as a         
function of telemetry mode.                                               
                                                                          
The PWS instrument uses two logarithmic compressors as detectors          
for the 16-channel spectrum analyzer, one for the bottom (lower           
frequency) 8 channels, and one for the upper (higher frequency) 8         
channels.  For each bank of 8 channels, the compressor                    
sequentially steps from the lowest frequency of the 8 to the              
highest in a regular time step to obtain a complete spectrum.  At         
each time step, the higher frequency channel is sampled 1/8 s             
prior to the lower frequency channel so that the channels are             
sampled in the following order with channel 1 being the lowest            
frequency channel (10 Hz) and 16 being the highest (56.2 kHz): 9,         
1, 10, 2, 11, 3, ...  15, 7, 16, 8.  The primary difference               
between the various data modes is the stepping rate from one              
channel to the next (ranging from 0.5 to 12 s, corresponding to           
temporal resolutions between complete spectra of 4 s to 96 s).            
                                                                          
In the following table, we present the hexadecimal id for the             
various telemetry modes, the mode mnemonic ID, the time between           
frequency steps, and the time between complete spectra.  We also          
provide the offset from the beginning of the instrument cycle (one        
complete spectrum) identified as the time of each record's time           
tag to the time of the sampling for the first high-frequency              
channel (channel 9) and for the first low-frequency channel               
(channel 1).                                                              
                                                                          
                                Time

<pre><code>This data set consists of electric field spectrum analyzer data           
from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Subsystem obtained during the              
entire mission.  Data after 2013-12-31 will be added to the archive
on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all spectrum             
analyzer observations obtained in the cruise mission phases               
before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter phases        
as well as those obtained during the two encounter phases.                
                                                                          
The Voyager 1 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 100 AU over         
the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when            
some key events occurred during the mission, the following table          
is provided.

<h1>Data Sampling</h1>
<pre><code>This data set consists of full resolution edited, wave electric           
field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver spectrum        
analyzer obtained during the entire mission.  For each time               
interval, a field strength is determined for each of the 16               
spectrum analyzer channels whose center frequencies range from 10         
Hertz to 56.2 kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in           
frequency, four channels per decade.  The time associated with            
each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of the beginning        
of the scan.  The time between spectra in this data set vary by           
telemetry mode and range from 4 seconds to 96 seconds.  During            
data gaps where complete spectra are missing, no entries exist in         
the file, that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any          
other way.  When one or more channels are missing within a scan,          
the missing measurements are zero-filled.  Data are edited but not        
calibrated.  The data numbers in this data set can be plotted in          
raw form for event searches and simple trend analysis since they          
are roughly proportional to the log of the electric field                 
strength.  Calibration procedures and tables are provided for use         
with this data set; the use of these is described below.                  
                                                                          
For the cruise data sets, the timing of samples is dependent upon         
the spacecraft telemetry mode.  In principle, one can determine           
the temporal resolution between spectra simply by noting the              
difference in time between two records in the files.  In some             
studies, more precise timing information is necessary.  Here, we          
describe the timing of the samples for the PWS low rate data as a         
function of telemetry mode.                                               
                                                                          
The PWS instrument uses two logarithmic compressors as detectors          
for the 16-channel spectrum analyzer, one for the bottom (lower           
frequency) 8 channels, and one for the upper (higher frequency) 8         
channels.  For each bank of 8 channels, the compressor                    
sequentially steps from the lowest frequency of the 8 to the              
highest in a regular time step to obtain a complete spectrum.  At         
each time step, the higher frequency channel is sampled 1/8 s             
prior to the lower frequency channel so that the channels are             
sampled in the following order with channel 1 being the lowest            
frequency channel (10 Hz) and 16 being the highest (56.2 kHz): 9,         
1, 10, 2, 11, 3, ...  15, 7, 16, 8.  The primary difference               
between the various data modes is the stepping rate from one              
channel to the next (ranging from 0.5 to 12 s, corresponding to           
temporal resolutions between complete spectra of 4 s to 96 s).            
                                                                          
In the following table, we present the hexadecimal id for the             
various telemetry modes, the mode mnemonic ID, the time between           
frequency steps, and the time between complete spectra.  We also          
provide the offset from the beginning of the instrument cycle (one        
complete spectrum) identified as the time of each record's time           
tag to the time of the sampling for the first high-frequency              
channel (channel 9) and for the first low-frequency channel               
(channel 1).                                                              
                                                                          
                                Time                                      
                    Frequency   Between      High Freq.  Low Freq.
