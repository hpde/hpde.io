Each 60-msec interval constitutes          \n    a line of waveform samples.  The data set includes frames of             \n    waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, or 48 seconds,           \n    each.  The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical           \n    to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as                   \n    constructs in describing the form of the data.                           \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Data Processing                                                            \n  ===============                                                            \n    Because there is no direct method for calibrating these data and         \n    because the raw format of packed, 4-bit samples is                       \n    space-efficient, these data are not processed for archiving.             \n    The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform;         \n    this is useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the           \n    spacecraft.  But the normal method of analyzing the waveform             \n    data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to            \n    arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.  By stacking           \n    the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-time                 \n    spectrogram can be produced.                                             \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Data                                                                       \n  ====                                                                       \n    The waveforms are collections of samples of the electric field           \n    measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800              \n    samples per second.  The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital           \n    values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but          \n    the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain           \n    control used in the waveform receiver.  The instantaneous                \n    dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 dB, but          \n    the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the             \n    passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the                \n    instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain control, the overall         \n    dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 dB.  The             \n    automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the               \n    ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data.            \n    However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier           \n    transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the                \n    spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained          \n    in most cases.                                                           \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Ancillary Data                                                             \n  ==============                                                             \n    None                                                                     \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Coordinates                                                                \n  ===========                                                                \n    The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole          \n    pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.         \n    However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured              \n    field to any particular direction such as the local magnetic             \n    field or direction to a planet.

<pre><code>This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from           
the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Subsystem waveform receiver obtained           
during the entire mission.  Data after 2013-11-02 will be added to the   
archive on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all             
waveform observations obtained in the cruise mission phases              
before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter              
phases as well as those obtained during the two encounter                
phases.                                                                  
                                                                         
The Voyager 1 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 100 AU over        
the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when           
some key events occurred during the mission, the following table         
is provided.

<h1>Data Sampling</h1>
<pre><code>The waveform is sampled at 4-bit resolution through a bandpass           
filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  1600 samples are             
collected in 55.56 msec (at a rate of 28,800 samples per second)         
followed by a 4.44-msec gap.  Each 60-msec interval constitutes          
a line of waveform samples.  The data set includes frames of             
waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, or 48 seconds,           
each.  The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical           
to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as                   
constructs in describing the form of the data.                           
</code></pre>
<h1>Data Processing</h1>
<pre><code>Because there is no direct method for calibrating these data and         
because the raw format of packed, 4-bit samples is                       
space-efficient, these data are not processed for archiving.             
The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform;         
this is useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the           
spacecraft.  But the normal method of analyzing the waveform             
data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to            
arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.  By stacking           
the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-time                 
spectrogram can be produced.

<h1>Data</h1>
<pre><code>The waveforms are collections of samples of the electric field           
measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800              
samples per second.  The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital           
values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but          
the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain           
control used in the waveform receiver.  The instantaneous                
dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 dB, but          
the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the             
passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the                
instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain control, the overall         
dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 dB.  The             
automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the               
ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data.            
However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier           
transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the                
spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained          
in most cases.

<h1>Coordinates</h1>
<pre><code>The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole          
pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.         
However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured              
field to any particular direction such as the local magnetic             
field or direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft

<pre><code>This data set consists of electric field waveform samples from           
the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Subsystem waveform receiver obtained           
during the entire mission.  Data after 2013-11-02 will be added to the   
archive on subsequent volumes.  The data set encompasses all             
waveform observations obtained in the cruise mission phases              
before, between, and after the Jupiter and Saturn encounter              
phases as well as those obtained during the two encounter                
phases.                                                                  
                                                                         
The Voyager 1 spacecraft travels from Earth to beyond 100 AU over        
the course of this data set.  To provide some guidance on when           
some key events occurred during the mission, the following table         
is provided.

<h1>Data Sampling</h1>
<pre><code>The waveform is sampled at 4-bit resolution through a bandpass           
filter with a passband of 40 Hz to 12 kHz.  1600 samples are             
collected in 55.56 msec (at a rate of 28,800 samples per second)         
followed by a 4.44-msec gap.  Each 60-msec interval constitutes          
a line of waveform samples.  The data set includes frames of             
waveform samples consisting of up to 800 lines, or 48 seconds,           
each.  The telemetry format for the waveform data is identical           
to that for images, hence the use of line and frame as                   
constructs in describing the form of the data.                           
</code></pre>
<h1>Data Processing</h1>
<pre><code>Because there is no direct method for calibrating these data and         
because the raw format of packed, 4-bit samples is                       
space-efficient, these data are not processed for archiving.             
The data may be plotted in raw form to show the actual waveform;         
this is useful for studying events such as dust impacts on the           
spacecraft.  But the normal method of analyzing the waveform             
data is by Fourier transforming the samples from each line to            
arrive at an amplitude versus frequency spectrum.  By stacking           
the spectra side-by-side in time order, a frequency-time                 
spectrogram can be produced.                                             
</code></pre>
<h1>Data</h1>
<pre><code>The waveforms are collections of samples of the electric field           
measured by the dipole electric antenna at a rate of 28,800              
samples per second.  The 4-bit samples provide sixteen digital           
values of the electric field with a linear amplitude scale, but          
the amplitude scale is arbitrary because of the automatic gain           
control used in the waveform receiver.  The instantaneous                
dynamic range afforded by the 4 bit samples is about 23 dB, but          
the automatic gain control allows the dominant signal in the             
passband to be set at the optimum level to fit within the                
instantaneous dynamic range.  With the gain control, the overall         
dynamic range of the waveform receiver is about 100 dB.  The             
automatic gain control gain setting is not returned to the               
ground, hence, there is no absolute calibration for the data.            
However, by comparing the waveform spectrum derived by Fourier           
transforming the waveform to the spectrum provided by the                
spectrum analyzer data, an absolute calibration may be obtained          
in most cases.                                                           
</code></pre>
<h1>Ancillary Data</h1>
<pre><code>None                                                                     
</code></pre>
<h1>Coordinates</h1>
<pre><code>The electric dipole antenna detects electric fields in a dipole          
pattern with peak sensitivity parallel to the spacecraft x-axis.         
However, no attempt has been made to correlate the measured              
field to any particular direction such as the local magnetic             
field or direction to a planet.  This is because the spacecraft          
remains in a 3-axis stabilized orientation almost continuously,
