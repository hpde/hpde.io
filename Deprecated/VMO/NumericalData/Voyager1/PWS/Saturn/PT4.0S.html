For each 4-second interval, a field strength             \n      is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels             \n      whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2                    \n      kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in                       \n      frequency, four channels per decade. The time associated                \n      with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of               \n      the beginning of the scan. During data gaps where complete              \n      4-second spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file,             \n      that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any                  \n      other way. When one or more channels are missing within a               \n      scan, the missing measurements are zero-filled. Data are                \n      edited but not calibrated. The data numbers in this data                \n      set can be plotted in raw form for event searches and                   \n      simple trend analysis since they are roughly proportional               \n      to the log of the electric field strength. Calibration                  \n      procedures and tables are provided for use with this data               \n      set; the use of these is described below.                               \n                                                                              \n      Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                   \n                                                                              \n      The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text             \n      file named SA_CL.TAB (for Voyager-1).

For example, the following VAX FORTRAN code          \n      may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 1 PWS:              \n                                                                              \n        real*4 cal (16,0:255)                                                 \n        open ( unit=10, file='SA_CL.TAB', status='old' )                      \n                                                                              \n        do i=0,255                                                            \n          read (10,*) idn, (cal(ichan,i),ichan=1,16)                          \n        end do                                                                \n        close (10)                                                            \n                                                                              \n      Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency            \n      channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage             \n      would be given by the following array reference:                        \n                                                                              \n        volts = cal (ichan, idn)                                              \n                                                                              \n      This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by             \n      dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.             \n      That is:                                                                \n                                                                              \n        efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07                                       \n                                                                              \n      Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square           \n      of the electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth          \n      of the corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.                         \n                                                                              \n        specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)                \n                                                                              \n      Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral            \n      density by the impedance of free space in ohms:                         \n                                                                              \n        pwrflux = ((cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2/bandwidth(ichan))/376.73          \n                                                                              \n      Of course, for a particular application, it may be more                 \n      efficient to apply the above conversions to the calibration             \n      table directly.                                                         \n                                                                              \n      The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum              \n      analyzer channel for the Voyager 1 PWS are given below:                 \n                                                                              \n      VOYAGER 1 PWS SPECTRUM ANALYZER                                         \n                                                                              \n      Voyager-1                                                               \n      Channel    Center Frequency      Bandwidth                              \n                                                                              \n      1             10.0 Hz             2.16  Hz                              \n      2             17.8 Hz             3.58  Hz                              \n      3             31.1 Hz             4.50  Hz                              \n      4             56.2 Hz            10.7   Hz                      ",

=================</p>
<pre><code>  Data Set Description                                                    
  --------------------                                                    
  This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric                
  field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver               
  spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Jovian                
  magnetosphere. For each 4-second interval, a field strength             
  is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels             
  whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2                    
  kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in                       
  frequency, four channels per decade. The time associated                
  with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of               
  the beginning of the scan. During data gaps where complete              
  4-second spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file,             
  that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any                  
  other way. When one or more channels are missing within a               
  scan, the missing measurements are zero-filled. Data are                
  edited but not calibrated. The data numbers in this data                
  set can be plotted in raw form for event searches and                   
  simple trend analysis since they are roughly proportional               
  to the log of the electric field strength. Calibration                  
  procedures and tables are provided for use with this data               
  set; the use of these is described below.                               
                                                                          
  Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                   
                                                                          
  The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text             
  file named SA_CL.TAB (for Voyager-1). This provides                     
  information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output            
  of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna           
  voltages for each frequency channel. Following is a brief               
  description of these files and a tutorial in their                      
  application.                                                            
                                                                          
  Descriptive headers have been removed from the calibration              
  table file. The columns included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02,             
  ICHAN03, ICHAN04, ICHAN05, ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.                        
                                                                          
  The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by          
  the corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16          
  frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer. Each line              
  contains calibrations for successive data number values                 
  ranging from 0 through 255. (Data number 0 actually represents          
  the lack of data since the baseline noise values for each               
  channel are all above that.)                                            
                                                                          
  A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a           
  data structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to              
  obtain the appropriate voltage for a given data number and              
  frequency channel. For example, the following VAX FORTRAN code          
  may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 1 PWS:              
                                                                          
    real*4 cal (16,0:255)                                                 
    open ( unit=10, file='SA_CL.TAB', status='old' )                      
                                                                          
    do i=0,255                                                            
      read (10,*) idn, (cal(ichan,i),ichan=1,16)                          
    end do                                                                
    close (10)                                                            
                                                                          
  Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency            
  channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage             
  would be given by the following array reference:                        
                                                                          
    volts = cal (ichan, idn)                                              
                                                                          
  This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by             
  dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.             
  That is:                                                                
                                                                          
    efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07                                       
                                                                          
  Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square           
  of the electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth          
  of the corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.                         
                                                                          
    specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)                
                                                                          
  Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral            
  density by the impedance of free space in ohms:                         
                                                                          
    pwrflux = ((cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2/bandwidth(ichan))/376.73          
                                                                          
  Of course, for a particular application, it may be more                 
  efficient to apply the above conversions to the calibration             
  table directly.                                                         
                                                                          
  The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum              
  analyzer channel for the Voyager 1 PWS are given below:

<pre><code>  Data Set Description                                                    
  --------------------                                                    
  This data set consists of 4-second edited, wave electric                
  field intensities from the Voyager 1 Plasma Wave Receiver               
  spectrum analyzer obtained in the vicinity of the Jovian                
  magnetosphere. For each 4-second interval, a field strength             
  is determined for each of the 16 spectrum analyzer channels             
  whose center frequencies range from 10 Hertz to 56.2                    
  kiloHertz and which are logarithmically spaced in                       
  frequency, four channels per decade. The time associated                
  with each set of intensities (16 channels) is the time of               
  the beginning of the scan. During data gaps where complete              
  4-second spectra are missing, no entries exist in the file,             
  that is, the gaps are not zero-filled or tagged in any                  
  other way. When one or more channels are missing within a               
  scan, the missing measurements are zero-filled. Data are                
  edited but not calibrated. The data numbers in this data                
  set can be plotted in raw form for event searches and                   
  simple trend analysis since they are roughly proportional               
  to the log of the electric field strength. Calibration                  
  procedures and tables are provided for use with this data               
  set; the use of these is described below.                               
                                                                          
  Use of Voyager PWS Calibration Tables                                   
                                                                          
  The Voyager PWS calibration table is given in an ASCII text             
  file named SA_CL.TAB (for Voyager-1). This provides                     
  information to convert the uncalibrated 'data number' output            
  of the PWS 16-channel spectrum analyzer to calibrated antenna           
  voltages for each frequency channel. Following is a brief               
  description of these files and a tutorial in their                      
  application.                                                            
                                                                          
  Descriptive headers have been removed from the calibration              
  table file. The columns included are IDN, ICHAN01, ICHAN02,             
  ICHAN03, ICHAN04, ICHAN05, ICHAN06, ... ICHAN16.                        
                                                                          
  The first column lists an uncalibrated data number followed by          
  the corresponding value in calibrated volts for each of the 16          
  frequency channels of the PWS spectrum analyzer. Each line              
  contains calibrations for successive data number values                 
  ranging from 0 through 255. (Data number 0 actually represents          
  the lack of data since the baseline noise values for each               
  channel are all above that.)                                            
                                                                          
  A data analysis program may load the appropriate table into a           
  data structure and thus provide a simple look-up scheme to              
  obtain the appropriate voltage for a given data number and              
  frequency channel. For example, the following VAX FORTRAN code          
  may be used to load a calibration array for Voyager 1 PWS:              
                                                                          
    real*4 cal (16,0:255)                                                 
    open ( unit=10, file='SA_CL.TAB', status='old' )                      
                                                                          
    do i=0,255                                                            
      read (10,*) idn, (cal(ichan,i),ichan=1,16)                          
    end do                                                                
    close (10)                                                            
                                                                          
  Then, given an uncalibrated data value idn for the frequency            
  channel ichan, the corresponding calibrated antenna voltage             
  would be given by the following array reference:                        
                                                                          
    volts = cal (ichan, idn)                                              
                                                                          
  This may be converted to a wave electric field amplitude by             
  dividing by the effective antenna length in meters, 7.07 m.             
  That is:                                                                
                                                                          
    efield = cal(ichan, idn) / 7.07                                       
                                                                          
  Spectral density units may be obtained by dividing the square           
  of the electric field value by the nominal frequency bandwidth          
  of the corresponding spectrum analyzer channel.                         
                                                                          
    specdens = (cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2 / bandwidth(ichan)                
                                                                          
  Finally, power flux may be obtained by dividing the spectral            
  density by the impedance of free space in ohms:                         
                                                                          
    pwrflux = ((cal(ichan,idn)/7.07)**2/bandwidth(ichan))/376.73          
                                                                          
  Of course, for a particular application, it may be more                 
  efficient to apply the above conversions to the calibration             
  table directly.                                                         
                                                                          
  The center frequencies and bandwidths of each PWS spectrum              
  analyzer channel for the Voyager 1 PWS are given below:
