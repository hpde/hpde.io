Vogt\n    Data Supplier         : National Space Science Data Center\n    Data sampling rate    : variable (1 hr for FPHA data, 15 min.\n                            for all others)\n\n    Data Set Start Time   : 1979-02-28T00:00:00.000Z\n    Data Set Stop Time    : 1979-03-21T23:45:00.000Z\n\n    (The following description has been adapted from\n    [NSSDCCRS1979])\n\n    As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was\n    designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B].  It consists\n    of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy Telescopes\n    (LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET).  The detectors have\n    large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster) and long\n    electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low power\n    consumption and good stability.  Normally, the data are\n    primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]\n    and E) pulse-height information about individual events.\n    Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and\n    Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in\n    single detectors and various coincidence rates.  In inter-\n    planetary space, guard counters are placed in anticoincidence\n    with the primary detectors to reduce the background from\n    high-energy particles penetrating through the sides of the\n    telescopes.  These guard counters were turned off in the Jovian\n    magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence rate became\n    high enough to block a substantial fraction of the desired\n    counts.  Fortunately, under these conditions the spectra were\n    sufficiently soft that the background, due to penetrating\n    particles, was small.\n\n    The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained with\n    the LET.  The thicknesses of individual solid-state detectors\n    in the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen such that,\n    even in the Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made, at most, a\n    very minor contribution to the proton counting rates\n    [LUPTON&amp;STONE1972].  Dead time corrections and accidental\n    coincidences were small (&lt; 20%) throughout most of the\n    magnetotail, but were substantial (&gt; 50%) at flux maxima within\n    40 R[J] Of Jupiter.  Data have been included in this package\n    for those periods when the corrections are less than ~ 50% and\n    can be corrected by the user with the dead time appropriate to\n    the detector (2 to 25 [micro]sec).  The high counting rates,\n    however, caused some baseline shift which may have raised\n    proton thresholds significantly.  In the inner magnetosphere,\n    the L[2] counting rate was still useful because it never rolled\n    over.  This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV protons penetrating\n    L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &gt; 9-MeV protons penetrating the\n    shield (8.4 cm^2 ster).  For an E^-2 spectrum, the two groups\n    would make comparable contributions; but in the magnetosphere,\n    for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV [MCDONALDETAL1979],\n    the contribution from protons penetrating the shield would be\n    only 3 to 14%.\n\n    The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-\n    anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8\n    MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution\n    (~10^-3).  Corrections are required for dead time losses in\n    L[1], accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence\n    losses from L[4].  Data are given only for periods when these\n    corrections are relatively small.  In addition to the rates\n    listed in the table, the energy lost in detectors L[1], L[2]\n    and L[3] was measured for individual particles.  For protons,\n    this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV.  Protons\n    can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs.  E technique,\n    their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly\n    reduced.  Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a\n    small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and\n    statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged\n    over a period of one hour.\n\n    HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-\n    height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one\n    another during periods of high counting rates.  To prevent such\n    an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,\n    the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each\n    192 seconds long.  Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on\n    at a time.  LET-D was cycled through L[1] only and L[1]L[2]\n    coincidence requirements.  The TET was cycled through various\n    coincidence conditions, including singles from the front\n    detectors.  At the expense of some time resolution, this\n    procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer\n    magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage\n    through the magnetotail region.\n\n    Some of the published results from this experiment required\n    extensive corrections for dead time, accidental coincidences\n    and anticoincidences ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B];\n    [SCHARDTETAL1981]; [GEHRELS1981]).  These corrections can be\n    applied only on a case-by-case basis after a careful study of\n    the environment and many self-consistency checks.  They cannot\n    be applied on a systematic basis and we have no computer\n    programs to do so; therefore, data from such periods are not\n    included in the Data Center submission.  The scientists on the\n    CRS team will, however, be glad to consider special requests if\n    the desired information can be extracted from the data.\n\n\n    Description of the Data\n    -----------------------\n      (1) LD1 RATE gives the nominal &gt; 0.43-MeV proton flux cm^-2\n          s^-1 sr^-1. This rate includes all particles which pass\n          through a 0.8 mg/cm^2 aluminum foil and deposits more than\n          220 keV in a 34.6 [micron] Si detector on Voyager 1 (209\n          keV, 33.9 [microns] on Voyager 2) Therefore, heavy ions,\n          such as oxygen and sulfur are also detected; however,\n          their contribution is believed to be relatively small.\n          Only a small percentage of the pulses in this detector are\n          larger than the maximum energy that can be deposited by a\n          proton.  Heavy ions would produce such large pulses,\n          unless their energy spectra were much steeper than the\n          proton spectrum. The true flux, F[t], can be calculated\n          from the data:\n\n                                      F\n                       F[t]  = ----------------\n                               1 - 1.26x10^-4 F\n\n           and corrections are small for F &lt; 1000 cm^-2 s^-1.\n\n\n      (2) LD2 RATE is not suitable for an absolute flux\n          determination and is given in counters per s. The detector\n          responds to protons and ions that penetrate either (a) 0.8\n          mg/cm^2 Al plus 8.0 mg/cm^2 Si and lose at least 200 keV\n          in a 35 [micron] Si detector (1.8 to 13 MeV) or (b) pass\n          through &gt; 140 mg/cm^2 Al. For an E^-2 proton spectrum, the\n          contributions from (a) and (b) would be about equal;\n          however, the proton spectrum is substantially softer\n          throughout most of the magnetosphere and the detector\n          should respond primarily to (a). Dead time corrections\n          are given by\n\n                                     R\n                      R[t]  = ----------------\n                              1 - 2.55x10^-5 R\n\n\n           where R is the count rate in counts/s. Thus, correction to\n           the supplied data are small for R &lt; 4000 c/sec, but become\n           80 large in the middle magnetosphere that the magnitude of\n           even relative intensity changes becomes uncertain.\n\n      (3) LD L[1].L[2]. L[4]. SL COINCIDENCE RATE gives the total\n          proton flux (cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1) between ~ 1.8 and ~ 8.1 MeV\n          with a small admixture of alpha particles.

As its name implies, the Cosmic Ray Subsystem (CRS) was
designed for cosmic ray studies [STONEETAL1977B].  It consists
of two high Energy Telescopes (HET), four Low Energy Telescopes
(LET) and The Electron Telescope (TET).  The detectors have
large geometric factors (~ 0.48 to 8 cm^2 ster) and long
electronic time constants (~ 24 [micro]sec) for low power
consumption and good stability.  Normally, the data are
primarily derived from comprehensive ([Delta]E[1], [Delta]E[2]
and E) pulse-height information about individual events.
Because of the high particle fluxes encountered at Jupiter and
Saturn, greater reliance had to be placed on counting rates in
single detectors and various coincidence rates.  In inter-
planetary space, guard counters are placed in anticoincidence
with the primary detectors to reduce the background from
high-energy particles penetrating through the sides of the
telescopes.  These guard counters were turned off in the Jovian
magnetosphere when the accidental anticoincidence rate became
high enough to block a substantial fraction of the desired
counts.  Fortunately, under these conditions the spectra were
sufficiently soft that the background, due to penetrating
particles, was small.

The data on proton and ion fluxes at Jupiter were obtained with
the LET.  The thicknesses of individual solid-state detectors
in the LET and their trigger thresholds were chosen such that,
even in the Jovian magnetosphere, electrons made, at most, a
very minor contribution to the proton counting rates
[LUPTON&amp;amp;STONE1972].  Dead time corrections and accidental
coincidences were small (&amp;lt; 20%) throughout most of the
magnetotail, but were substantial (&amp;gt; 50%) at flux maxima within
40 R[J] Of Jupiter.  Data have been included in this package
for those periods when the corrections are less than ~ 50% and
can be corrected by the user with the dead time appropriate to
the detector (2 to 25 [micro]sec).  The high counting rates,
however, caused some baseline shift which may have raised
proton thresholds significantly.  In the inner magnetosphere,
the L[2] counting rate was still useful because it never rolled
over.  This rate is due to 1.8- to 13-MeV protons penetrating
L[1] (0.43 cm^2 ster) and &amp;gt; 9-MeV protons penetrating the
shield (8.4 cm^2 ster).  For an E^-2 spectrum, the two groups
would make comparable contributions; but in the magnetosphere,
for the E^-3 to E^-4 spectrum above 2.5 MeV [MCDONALDETAL1979],
the contribution from protons penetrating the shield would be
only 3 to 14%.

The LET L[1]L[2]L[4] and L[1]L[2]L[3] coincidence-
anticoincidence rates give the proton flux between 1.8 and 8
MeV and 3 to 8 MeV with a small alpha particle contribution
(~10^-3).  Corrections are required for dead time losses in
L[1], accidental L[1]L[2] coincidences and anticoincidence
losses from L[4].  Data are given only for periods when these
corrections are relatively small.  In addition to the rates
listed in the table, the energy lost in detectors L[1], L[2]
and L[3] was measured for individual particles.  For protons,
this covered the energy range from 0.42 to 8.3 MeV.  Protons
can be identified positively by the [Delta]E vs.  E technique,
their spectra obtained and accidental coincidences greatly
reduced.  Because of telemetry limitations, however, only a
small fraction of the events could be transmitted, and
statistics become poor unless pulse-height data are averaged
over a period of one hour.

HET and LET detectors share the same data lines and pulse-
height analyzers; thus, the telescopes can interfere with one
another during periods of high counting rates.  To prevent such
an interference and explore different coincidence conditions,
the experiment was cycled through four operating modes, each
192 seconds long.  Either the HETs or the LETs were turned on
at a time.  LET-D was cycled through L[1] only and L[1]L[2]
coincidence requirements.  The TET was cycled through various
coincidence conditions, including singles from the front
detectors.  At the expense of some time resolution, this
procedure permitted us to obtain significant data in the outer
magnetosphere and excellent data during the long passage
through the magnetotail region.

Some of the published results from this experiment required
extensive corrections for dead time, accidental coincidences
and anticoincidences ([VOGTETAL1979A], [VOGTETAL1979B];
[SCHARDTETAL1981]; [GEHRELS1981]).  These corrections can be
applied only on a case-by-case basis after a careful study of
the environment and many self-consistency checks.  They cannot
be applied on a systematic basis and we have no computer
programs to do so; therefore, data from such periods are not
included in the Data Center submission.  The scientists on the
CRS team will, however, be glad to consider special requests if
the desired information can be extracted from the data.


Description of the Data
-----------------------
  (1) LD1 RATE gives the nominal &amp;gt; 0.43-MeV proton flux cm^-2
      s^-1 sr^-1. This rate includes all particles which pass
      through a 0.8 mg/cm^2 aluminum foil and deposits more than
      220 keV in a 34.6 [micron] Si detector on Voyager 1 (209
      keV, 33.9 [microns] on Voyager 2) Therefore, heavy ions,
      such as oxygen and sulfur are also detected; however,
      their contribution is believed to be relatively small.
      Only a small percentage of the pulses in this detector are
      larger than the maximum energy that can be deposited by a
      proton.  Heavy ions would produce such large pulses,
      unless their energy spectra were much steeper than the
      proton spectrum. The true flux, F[t], can be calculated
      from the data:

                                  F
                   F[t]  = ----------------
                           1 - 1.26x10^-4 F

       and corrections are small for F &amp;lt; 1000 cm^-2 s^-1.


  (2) LD2 RATE is not suitable for an absolute flux
      determination and is given in counters per s. The detector
      responds to protons and ions that penetrate either (a) 0.8
      mg/cm^2 Al plus 8.0 mg/cm^2 Si and lose at least 200 keV
      in a 35 [micron] Si detector (1.8 to 13 MeV) or (b) pass
      through &amp;gt; 140 mg/cm^2 Al. For an E^-2 proton spectrum, the
      contributions from (a) and (b) would be about equal;
      however, the proton spectrum is substantially softer
      throughout most of the magnetosphere and the detector
      should respond primarily to (a). Dead time corrections
      are given by

                                 R
                  R[t]  = ----------------
                          1 - 2.55x10^-5 R


       where R is the count rate in counts/s. Thus, correction to
       the supplied data are small for R &amp;lt; 4000 c/sec, but become
       80 large in the middle magnetosphere that the magnitude of
       even relative intensity changes becomes uncertain.

  (3) LD L[1].L[2]. L[4]. SL COINCIDENCE RATE gives the total
      proton flux (cm^-2 s^-1 sr^-1) between ~ 1.8 and ~ 8.1 MeV
      with a small admixture of alpha particles. Accidental
      coincidences become subst</code></pre>
