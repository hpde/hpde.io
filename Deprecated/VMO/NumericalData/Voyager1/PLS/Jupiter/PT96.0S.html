It is calculated using the              \n      method of [MCNUTTETAL1981] which to first order consists of            \n      taking the total measured current and dividing by the                  \n      collector area and plasma bulk velocity.  This method is only          \n      accurate for high mach number flows directly into the                  \n      detector, and may result in underestimates of the total                \n      density of a factor of 2 in the outer magnetosphere.  Thus             \n      absolute densities should be treated with caution, but                 \n      density variations in the data set can be trusted.  The low            \n      resolution mode density is used before 1979 63 1300, after             \n      this the larger of the high and low resolution mode densities          \n      in a 96 sec period is used since the L-mode spectra often are          \n      saturated.  Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a                 \n      constant velocity component of 200 km/s into the D cup is              \n      used outside of this.  These are the densities given in                \n      [MCNUTTETAL1981] corrected by a factor of 1.209 (.9617) for            \n      densities obtained from the side (main) sensor.  This                  \n      correction is due to a better calculation of the effective             \n      area of the sensors.

Discrimination with regard to mass and or          \n      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,            \n      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument              \n      limitations.                                                           \n                                                                             \n      Many different forms of ion density are derived.  Some are             \n      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or          \n      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                  \n      moments).  In some cases, more than one type of density will           \n      be provided in a single data set.  In general, if more than            \n      one ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total          \n      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                   \n      densities.  If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian           \n      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as             \n      the sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of           \n      each Maxwellian is given.                                              \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Source Instrument Parameters                                               \n  ============================                                               \n    Instrument Host ID              : VG1                                    \n    Data Set Parameter Name         : ION DENSITY                            \n    Instrument Parameter Name       : ION RATE                               \n                                      ION CURRENT                            \n                                      PARTICLE MULTIPLE PARAMETERS           \n    Important Instrument Parameters : 1 (for all parameters)                 \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Processing                                                                 \n  ==========                                                                 \n                                                                             \n    Processing History                                                       \n    ------------------                                                       \n      Source Data Set ID          : VG1-PLS                                  \n      Software                    : MOMANAL                                  \n      Product Data Set ID         : VG1-J-PLS-5-ION-MOM-96.0SEC              \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n    Software 'MOMANAL'                                                       \n    ------------------                                                       \n      Software ",

Discrimination with regard to mass and or          \n      charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,            \n      mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument              \n      limitations.                                                           \n                                                                             \n      Many different forms of ion density are derived.  Some are             \n      distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or          \n      their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                  \n      moments).  In some cases, more than one type of density will           \n      be provided in a single data set.  In general, if more than            \n      one ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total          \n      density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                   \n      densities.  If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian           \n      distribution the actual distribution can be represented as             \n      the sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of           \n      each Maxwellian is given.                                              \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Source Instrument Parameters                                               \n  ============================                                               \n    Instrument Host ID              : VG1                                    \n    Data Set Parameter Name         : ION DENSITY                            \n    Instrument Parameter Name       : ION RATE                               \n                                      ION CURRENT                            \n                                      PARTICLE MULTIPLE PARAMETERS           \n    Important Instrument Parameters : 1 (for all parameters)                 \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n  Processing                                                                 \n  ==========                                                                 \n                                                                             \n    Processing History                                                       \n    ------------------                                                       \n      Source Data Set ID          : VG1-PLS                                  \n      Software                    : MOMANAL                                  \n      Product Data Set ID         : VG1-J-PLS-5-ION-MOM-96.0SEC              \n                                                                             \n                                                                             \n    Software 'MOMANAL'                                                       \n    ------------------                                                       \n      Software ",

  This version 1.1 data set replaces the version 1.0 data set            
  (DATA_SET_ID = VG1-J-PLS-5-ION-MOM-96.0SEC) previously                 
  archived with the PDS.                                                 
                                                                         
                                                                         
Data Set Description                                                     
--------------------                                                     
  This data set contains the best estimates of the total ion             
  density at Jupiter during the Voyager 1 encounter in the PLS           
  voltage range (10-5950 eV/Q).  It is calculated using the              
  method of [MCNUTTETAL1981] which to first order consists of            
  taking the total measured current and dividing by the                  
  collector area and plasma bulk velocity.  This method is only          
  accurate for high mach number flows directly into the                  
  detector, and may result in underestimates of the total                
  density of a factor of 2 in the outer magnetosphere.  Thus             
  absolute densities should be treated with caution, but                 
  density variations in the data set can be trusted.  The low            
  resolution mode density is used before 1979 63 1300, after             
  this the larger of the high and low resolution mode densities          
  in a 96 sec period is used since the L-mode spectra often are          
  saturated.  Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a                 
  constant velocity component of 200 km/s into the D cup is              
  used outside of this.  These are the densities given in                
  [MCNUTTETAL1981] corrected by a factor of 1.209 (.9617) for            
  densities obtained from the side (main) sensor.  This                  
  correction is due to a better calculation of the effective             
  area of the sensors.  Data format: column 1 is time                    
  (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2 is the moment density in          
  cm^-3.  Each row has format (a24, 1x, 1pe9.2).  Values of              
  -9.99e+10 indicate that the parameter could not be obtained            
  from the data using the standard analysis technique.

  which produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog.  An

  A derived parameter equaling the number of ions per unit               
  volume over a specified range of ion energy, energy/charge,            
  or energy/nucleon.  Discrimination with regard to mass and or          
  charge state is necessary to obtain this quantity, however,            
  mass and charge state are often assumed due to instrument              
  limitations.                                                           
                                                                         
  Many different forms of ion density are derived.  Some are             
  distinguished by their composition (N+, proton, ion, etc.) or          
  their method of derivation (Maxwellian fit, method of                  
  moments).  In some cases, more than one type of density will           
  be provided in a single data set.  In general, if more than            
  one ion species is analyzed, either by moment or fit, a total          
  density will be provided which is the sum of the ion                   
  densities.  If a plasma component does not have a Maxwellian           
  distribution the actual distribution can be represented as             
  the sum of several Maxwellians, in which case the density of           
  each Maxwellian is given.

  This version 1.1 data set replaces the version 1.0 data set            
  (DATA_SET_ID = VG1-J-PLS-5-ION-MOM-96.0SEC) previously                 
  archived with the PDS.                                                 
                                                                         
                                                                         
Data Set Description                                                     
--------------------                                                     
  This data set contains the best estimates of the total ion             
  density at Jupiter during the Voyager 1 encounter in the PLS           
  voltage range (10-5950 eV/Q).  It is calculated using the              
  method of [MCNUTTETAL1981] which to first order consists of            
  taking the total measured current and dividing by the                  
  collector area and plasma bulk velocity.  This method is only          
  accurate for high mach number flows directly into the                  
  detector, and may result in underestimates of the total                
  density of a factor of 2 in the outer magnetosphere.  Thus             
  absolute densities should be treated with caution, but                 
  density variations in the data set can be trusted.  The low            
  resolution mode density is used before 1979 63 1300, after             
  this the larger of the high and low resolution mode densities          
  in a 96 sec period is used since the L-mode spectra often are          
  saturated.  Corotation is assumed inside L=17.5, and a                 
  constant velocity component of 200 km/s into the D cup is              
  used outside of this.  These are the densities given in                
  [MCNUTTETAL1981] corrected by a factor of 1.209 (.9617) for            
  densities obtained from the side (main) sensor.  This                  
  correction is due to a better calculation of the effective             
  area of the sensors.  Data format: column 1 is time                    
  (yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.sssZ), column 2 is the moment density in          
  cm^-3.  Each row has format (a24, 1x, 1pe9.2).  Values of              
  -9.99e+10 indicate that the parameter could not be obtained            
  from the data using the standard analysis technique.                   
  Additional information about this data set and the instrument          
  which produced it can be found elsewhere in this catalog.  An          
  overview of the data in this data set can be found in
