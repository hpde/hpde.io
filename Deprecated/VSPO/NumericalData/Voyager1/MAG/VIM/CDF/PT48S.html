The spacecraft magnetic field is a complex, time-dependent signal that must be removed from the measured magnetic field signal in order to derive the ambient magnetic fields of the solar wind and heliosheath. Corrections must also be made for spurious magnetic signals and noise associated with the telemetry system, ground tracking systems, and other factors. Extracting the signal describing the solar wind and heliosheath from the many sources of uncertainty is a complex and partly subjective process that requires understanding of the instrument and judgement based on experience in dealing with the ever-changing extraneous signals. We estimate that for the Voyager magnetic field data the 1-sigma the uncertainty of the 48-s averages for each of the components of the magnetic field BR, BT, and BN is typically +/- 0.02 nT; the uncertainty in magnitude F1 is typically +/- 0.03 nT.
