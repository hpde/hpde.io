        "Description": "The Canberra Ionosonde station near Canberra, ACT, Australia, has a Ionosonde since March 1937. The first ionosonde was an analog ionosonde with Nitrate film from 01/1938 to 11/1951 (1937-1948, pre J28 ionosonde, the ionogram were generally of poor quality). Between 01/12/51 and 30/07/1977, there was an analog ionosonde with 35 mm film, and between 01/08/1977 and 02/06/1996, an ionosonde with 16 mm film. According to the SWS archived Weekly Station Summary, there was an IPS 4B (14/04/1982 to 08/07/1985), an IPS 16 mm film 3E (25/08/1982 to 13/10/1982) and Navy remote sonde (16/08/1983 to 13/01/1984). There was an IPS 4D digital ionosonde between 06/1994 and 06/1997, an IPS 5A between 01/1991 and 11/1996, and a CADI between 11/1997 and 08/2012. There is an IPS 5D since 03/1999 to now. The IPS 5D vertical sounding ionosonde normally sweeps in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.",
