        "Description": "The Canberra Magnetometer station in Canberra, ACT, Australia, has a Magnetometer since April 1997. \n      \n      April, 1997\n      -----------\n      Data type: \"b\"\n      Magnetometer data from the Canberra station commenced transfer to the ASFC. The magnetometer was one of the instruments from the STEL organisation from Japan which was already located at the IPS station as part of a chain of magnetometers along the 210 MM longitude. An IPS magnetometer data acquisition system (12-bit A/D) was  connected to the ouput of the STEL magnetometer.  There were some initial problems with noise spike which were overcome by placing the A/D PC up in the magnetometer hut rather than down in the IPS main building. \n\n      The magnetometer has a LH coordinate system.\n\n      For more information, please read its log file.     \n      ",
