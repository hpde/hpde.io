         <Description>The Hobart Ionosonde station near Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, has ionosondes since December 1945. The first is an analog ionosonde with nitrate film from 12/1945 to 11/1951. Between 09/11/1951 and 01/06/1977, there was an ionosonde with 35 mm film. According to SWS archived Hobart scaled ionospheric data book, At least between 90/1970 and 12/1970 the ionosonde was IPS 3D. Between 02/06/1977 and 20/12/1996, there was an ionosonde with 16 mm film in operation. According to SWS archived Weekly Station Summary, there was an IPS 4B at least from 17/03/1982 and an IPS 3E in the year of 1982 too. There was an IPS 4D between 28/02/1994 and 15/09/2001, an IPS 5A between 09/01/1991 and 17/04/1997, and a CADI between 14/10/1998 and 16/02/2009. There is an IPS 5D since 24/09/1998 to now. The IPS 5D vertical sounding ionosonde normally sweeps in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.</Description>
