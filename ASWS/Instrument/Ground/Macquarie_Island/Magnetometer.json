        "Description": "The Macquarie Island Magnetometer station in Macquarie Island, Tasmania, Australia, has a Induction Magnetometer since August 2000. \n     \n     \t15 August, 2000\n     \t---------------\n     \tData type: \"p\"\n     \tData being received in ASFC from ANTDIV. The instrument is an induction magnetometer for recording geomagnetic pulsations and is owned by the University of Newcastle and operated by ANTDIV. Presently there is no calibration information available for converting the data to variations in nanoTesla. This information has been requested from the University of Newcastle Space Plasma Waves Research Group and as yet there has been no reply. \n     \t(RAM - 16/10/00)\n     \n     \t3 April, 2006 (ANTDIV/RAM)\n\n     \tTelecommunications wish to advise of the following outage, currently affecting data circuits to Casey, Davis, Macquarie Island and Mawson.\n        \n\tFor more information, please read its log file.     \n      ",
