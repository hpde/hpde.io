        "Description": "The Vanimo Ionosonde station near Vanimo, Papua New Guinea, had ionosondes since August of 1964. According to the SWS archived scaled ionospheric data book, between 07/1964 and 05/1967 there was a Cossor 7562C ionosonde with 16 mm film, and since 06/1967, there was an IPS 3D ionosonde. According to the SWS archived Weekly Station Summary, there was records of IPS 3D up to 13/10/1982. There also were records about a Kel ionosonde in 30/06/1983 and 17/07/1983. There was IPS 4D between 06/03/1995 and 16/10/2000, an IPS 5A between 20/02/1991 and 22/12/1993, a CADI between 08/08/1999 and 22/02/2006, and an IPS 5D since 31/03/1999 to 17/07/2009. The IPS 5D vertical sounding ionosonde normally swept in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.",
