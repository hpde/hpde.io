         <Description>The Mawson Ionosonde station in Mawson, Antarctica, has ionosondes since February 1958. According to the SWS archived scaled ionospheric data book, the first one was an IPS 3A ionosonde with 35 mm film since 18/02/1958 to 01/1960. and then a Cossor 7562C ionosonde since 02/1960 to 12/1969 (or to 19/04/1976) with 35 mm film. Since 05/06/1975 to 05/05/1995, there was an ionosonde with 16 mm film in operation. There was an IPS 4D between 19/01/1994 and 31/01/2000, and an IPS 5D between 01/02/2000 and 04/02/2010. There is a CADI since 09/02/2009 to now. The CADI vertical sounding ionosonde normally sweeps in frequency from about 1.0 to 20 MHz. Three standard sweeps are provided: low resolution (100 frequencies), medium resolution (200 frequencies), high resolution (400 frequencies). The step size may be selected to be linear or logarithmic. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale. Height range up to 512 km (to be increased to 1000 km) with 6 km resolution. Every five minutes, a Ionogram data file is recorded, cleaned and the cleaned ionogram is transferred to SWS Sydney head office for autoscaling and further analysis.</Description>
