        "Description": "The Christchurch Ionosonde station near Christchurch, New Zealand, had ionosondes since August of 1942. According to INAG-4 and INAG-38, in 1969, a N.Z. P2 ionosonde was operated with 1.0-22.00 MHz frequency range, and from I January 1983, an IPS-42 ionosonde would be operating at Eyrewell 43° 25.2' S, 172° 20.3' E. Eyrewell Forest is a small rural area in the Waimakariri District, New Zealand, close to Christchurch, in 50 km. The ionograms from this site will be scaled to produce the published data. There was an IPS 4D between 08/1994 and 10/2011, a CADI between 01/2014 and 04/2014, and an IPS 5D since 05/2012 to 01/2014. The IPS 5D vertical sounding ionosonde normally swept in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.",
