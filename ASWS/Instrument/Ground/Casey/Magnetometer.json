        "Description": "The Casey Magnetometer station in Casey, Antarctica, has two digital Magnetometers since August 2000. \n      \n      16 August, 2000\n      ---------------\n      Data type: \"h\"\n      Data started being received in the ASFC from ANTDIV Fluxgate magnetometer. Files were for 5 minutes of data which are appended into a single file for the corresponding fraction of the hour before processing. As the calibration values were unknown at this point in time, the same values as for Davis were used.\n\n      16 August, 2000\n      ---------------\n      Data type: \"p\"\n      Data being received in ASFC from ANTDIV. The instrument is an induction magnetometer for recording geomagnetic pulsations and is owned by the University of Newcastle and operated by ANTDIV. Presently there is no calibration information available for converting the data to variations in nanoTesla. This information has been requested from the University of Newcastle Space Plasma Waves Research Group and as yet there has been no reply. \n      (RAM - 16/10/00)\n\n      For more information, please read its log file.     \n      ",
