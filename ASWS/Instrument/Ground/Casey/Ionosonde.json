        "Description": "The Casey Ionosonde station in Casey, Antarctica, has Ionosondes since July 1957. According to INAG-3 and SWS archived Wilkes scaled ionospheric data book (Series D), a C4 ionosonde provided by USA was operated in Wilkes between 02/1957 and 01/1969, and the an IPS 3D ionosonde with 35 mm film was operated since between 03/1969, and then an analog ionosonde with 16 mm film since 14/04/1989 to 03/03/1992. There was a CADI ionosonde between 02/1993 and 10/2001, and an IPS 5D ionosonde since October 1999. The IPS 5D vertical sounding ionosonde normally sweeps in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.",
