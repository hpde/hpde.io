        "Description": "The Auckland Ionosonde station near Auckland, New Zealand, had an ionosonde since 01/1967. According to INAG-4, in 1969, a C-2/3 ionosonde was operated with 0.75-25.00 MHz frequency range. According to \"9. COMPUTER CONTROL OF AN IPS-42 IONOSONDE\" in IANG Web-60 and \"Computer-controlled operation of the IPS-42 ionosonde\" in INAG uag-104, there was an IPS-42 ionosonde in operation between 1983 and 1994 (perhaps). An IPS 4D digital Ionosonde was in operation between 1992 and 1998. The Auckland hourly scaled data and median data of foF2 and M(3000)F2 are available since 01/1967 to 12/1978.",
