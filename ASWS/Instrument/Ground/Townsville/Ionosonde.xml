         <Description>The Townsville Ionosonde station near Townsville, Queensland, Australia, has ionosondes since June of 1946. There is no information available for earlier ionosondes. According to the SWS archived Weekly Station Summary, there was an IPS 4B ionosonde with 16 mm film in 06/05/1981 and up to 27/07/1989. In 07/07/1982, there was a record that a 35 mm film was used too. There was an IPS 4D between 13/05/1994 and 18/12/2001,an IPS 5A between 01/01/1991 and 03/09/1998, and a CADI between 03/09/1998 and 15/08/2000. There is an IPS 5D since 17/08/2000 to now. The IPS 5D vertical sounding ionosonde normally sweeps in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.</Description>
