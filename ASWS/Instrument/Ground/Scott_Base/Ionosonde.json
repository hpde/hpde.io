        "Description": "The Scott Base Ionosonde station in Scott Base, Antarctica, has Ionosondes since January of 1958. According to INAG-4, INAG-38 and INAG-39, in 1969, a N.Z. P2 ionosonde was operated with 1.0-22.00 MHz frequency range. In 1983, a P2 ionosonde had been operated and was replaced by an IPS-42 in January 1983. The current IPS 4D ionosonde was in operation since December of 1993. The IPS 4D vertical sounding ionosonde normally sweeps in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 4D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale. Every five minutes, a Ionogram data file is recorded, cleaned and the cleaned ionogram is transferred to Sydney SWS head office for scaling and further analysis.",
