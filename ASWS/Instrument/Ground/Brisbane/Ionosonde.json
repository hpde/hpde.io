        "Description": "The Brisbane Ionosonde station near Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, has ionosondes since as early as June of 1943. The first ionosonde was an analog ionosonde with Nitrate film from 08/06/1943 to 21/12/1952. Between 01/01/1953 and 30/12/1978, there was an analog ionosonde with 35 mm film, and between 11/01/1979 and 31/12/1986, an ionosonde with 16 mm film. According to INAG-38, in January 1983, There were two ionosondes at this site, but they were only run for special campaigns. According to the SWS archived Weekly Station Summary, at least there was an IPS 4B ionosonde between 10/03/1982 and 03/02/1983 and an IPS 3E ionosonde between 03/02/1982 and 17/03/1986. IPS 5D digital Ionosonde was in operation since May of 1998, after an IPS 5C ionosonde was run for 10 months from June 1997 to April 1998. The 5D vertical sounding ionosonde normally sweeps in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution for the 5D is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale.",
