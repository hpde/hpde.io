        "Description": "The Kingston station in Kingston, 5 km to Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, had a Cosmic Ray system since June 2004 to November 2016.\n\nCosmic rays consist mainly of protons. They can originate from galactic cosmic radiation or from the Sun. Cosmic rays are observed indirectly by a device known as a neutron monitor. When cosmic ray particles enter the Earth's atmosphere they interact with the nuclei of the air molecules to produce secondary radiation. This consists of pions (which decay to muons) and a shower of protons and neutrons. The neutrons predominate in this secondary radiation because the protons, being charged are more easily attenuated in subsequent travel. The cosmic ray detector actual detects these secondary neutrons and as a consequence is referred to as a neutron monitor.\n\nKingston data no longer available due to equipment failure since November 2016.",
