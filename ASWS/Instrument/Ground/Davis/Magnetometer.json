        "Description": "The Davis Magnetometer station in Davis, Antarctica, has two digital Magnetometers since December 1999 and August 2000. \n\n     6 December, 1999\n     ----------------\n     Data type: \"e\"\n     Magnetometer and acquisition system are operated by the Antarctic Division. I believe the instrument maybe an AGSO fluxgate and the acquisition system uses a 16-bit A/D.\n     (RAM - 15/12/99)\n\n     20 August, 2000\n     ---------------\n     Data type: \"p\"\n     Data being received in ASFC from ANTDIV. The instrument is an induction magnetometer for recording geomagnetic pulsations and is owned by the University of Newcastle and operated by ANTDIV. Presently there is no calibration information available for converting the data to variations in nanoTesla. This information has been requested from the University of Newcastle Space Plasma Waves Research Group and as yet there has been no reply.\n     (RAM - 16/10/00)\n\n      For more information, please read its log file.     \n      ",
