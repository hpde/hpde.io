        "Description": "\n\t  A riometer (relative ionospheric opacity meter) (30 MHz) is an instrument used to quantify the amount of electromagnetic wave ionospheric absorption in the atmosphere.[1] As the name implies, a riometer measures the \"opacity\" of the ionosphere to radio noise emanating from distant stars and galaxies. In the absence of any ionospheric absorption, this radio noise, averaged over a sufficiently long period of time, forms a quiet-day curve. Increased ionization in the ionosphere will cause absorption of radio signals (both terrestrial and extraterrestrial), and a departure from the quiet-day curve. The difference between the quiet-day curve and the riometer signal is an indicator of the amount of absorption, and is measured in decibels. Riometers are generally passive radio antenna operating in the VHF radio frequency range (~30 MHz). The SWS WDC archives Riometer data obtained from Casey, Davis, Mawson and Macquarie Island in Antarctica. The first Riometer data file from Macquarie Island was obtained on 11/09/1987. \n      ",
