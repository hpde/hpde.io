        "Description": "Ionograms are an image of frequency versus time delay (virtual height) of HF echoes from the ionosphere recorded by an ionosonde. An ionosonde is a swept frequency HF pulsed radar used to monitor the ionosphere. SWS WDC has archived ionogram data from 26 stations, 12 of them are still active at present. A vertical analog ionosonde had been installed at Watheroo and sounded since 31/05/1938 to 13/03/1959. The vertical sounding ionosondes normally sweep in frequency from about 1.0 to 21.5 MHz. Frequency step resolution is 5 kHz, with up to 4095 steps available. The step interval is variable, becoming more coarse at higher frequencies as ionograms are generally displayed on a logarithmic scale. Every five minutes, a Ionogram data file is recorded, The raw ionogram is recorded in a film, which will be posted to Sydney SWS head office every month. SWS manually scaled and archived all ionogram films. There is no digital raw or clean ionogram data for Watheroo. The Watheroo scaled hourly ionospheric data include parameters of foF2, foF1, FoE, foEs, fbEs, fmin, fxl, f'scaling F/s, M(3000)F2, h'F2, h'F, h'E, h'Es, h'Scaling R/S and Type Es. They are available since 31/05/1938 to 13/03/1959. The Watheroo median data of foF2 and M(3000)F2 are available since 05/1938 to 03/1959.\n\nWatheroo station is in operation from July of 1935 to March of 1959. Since April of 1959 Watheroo was replaced by Mundaring Observatory station.",
