        "Description": "Australia has made major contributions to research in solar physics for several decades. Solar images are a major kind of records of solar activities. The SWS has monitored and archived solar activity images from Culgoora and Learmonth for more than two decades. They include H-Alpha (2003-2014) and White Light(2004-2013) images from Culgoora, and H-Alpha(2004-2009), GONG H-Alpha(since 2013), GONG White Light(since 2010)and GONG Magnetogram(since 2010) images from Learmonth. Learmonth solar image data is available since 31/05/2004.",
        "Acknowledgement": "We are thankful to the United States Air Force at Learmonth Solar Observatory for supplying the GONG instrumentation and image data flow, as well as the USAF staff and Bureau of Meteorology of Australia staff for maintaining and providing the solar image data in near real time.",
