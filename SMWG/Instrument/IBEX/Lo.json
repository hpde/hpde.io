        "Description": "The IBEX-Lo instrument measures ENA's in eight energy\nbands within the 0.01-2.0 keV range.  The instrument is a single-pixel\nimager with a 7x7 deg field of view (FOV) in three 90 deg quadrants and\na 3.5 x 3.5 deg FOV in a fourth, \"high resolution\" quadrant. \nThe eight energy windows overlap and have center energies of 14, 27, 52,\n102, 197, 451, 908 and 1903 eV.  These are referred to as bands 1 to 8,\nrespectively, in data products.  The instrumentation includes a triple-\ncoincidence time-of-flight mass spectrometer to help distinguish between\nheliospheric hydrogen and interstellar oxygen and helium. The instrument\nimages full 360 deg swaths of the sky each 15-sec spacecraft spin about\nthe sun-pointing spin axis.  In normal operation, two successive spins\nare devoted to each energy window every 16 spin (~4 min) periods.",
