        "Description": "This experiment consisted of three 3-element telescopes, all looking normal to the spacecraft spin axis. A bidirectional telescope measured 20- to 800-MeV/nucleon particles with 5 to 10% energy resolution. Another telescope measured 3- to 22-MeV/nucleon particles with 5% resolution. These two telescopes measured particles with Z values between 1 and 8. The third telescope measured 50-keV to 1-MeV electrons and 50-keV to 20-MeV protons with 20% resolution. Data include the interplanetary region.",
