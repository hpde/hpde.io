        "Description": "The Magnetic Field Experiment (MFE) includes a fluxgate magnetometer sensor mounted on a 2.3 m boom (Potemra et al., IEEE Trans. Geosci. Remote Sensing, Vol. GE-23, 246, 1985). The fluxgate sensor was sampled at a rate of 8 vector samples/s. It had seven automatically switchable ranges (from plus and minus 16 nT to plus and minus 65,536 nT) with resolution commensurate with a 13-bit A/D converter, and was read out at 8.6 vector samples/s. The signals from two sensors (one parallel to the spin axis and one orthogonal) were also fed into 5-50 Hz bandpass channels that were read out every 5 s. The data span the entire AMPTE/CCE mission, from 1984 day 234, August 21, through 1989 day 009 with occasional data gaps. A lengthy data gap occurred in 1986 from day 252, September 9, ∼1300UT through day 286, October 12, ∼1800UT, during an extended eclipse period. For more details, see T. A. Potemra et al., IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Vol. GE-23, p. 246, 1985.",
