        "Description": "DMSP/F15, Operational Linescan System, OLS, The OLS measures visible (0.4-1.1 micrometers) and infrared (10.25-12.6 micrometers) wavelengths to provide day and night cloud cover imagery. The satellite measures data at a 0.56 km resolution, which is averaged on board, to produce global coverage at 2.7 km resolution. All of the 2.7 km resolution (smooth) data is downlinked to the ground sites while a small amount of the 0.56 km resolution (fine) data is stored and downlinked. The OLS is the primary sensor on each DMSP satellite.",
