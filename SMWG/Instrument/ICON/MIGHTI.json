        "Description": "The MIGHTI instrument measures the horizontal wind speed and direction (the wind vector). Each MIGHTI unit measures the wind along its line of sight. Two discrete MIGHTI units, their views separated by 90 degrees, are mounted on the ICON Payload Interface Plate. Combining data from both units, this 90 degrees separation between their views allows the wind vector to be determined.",
