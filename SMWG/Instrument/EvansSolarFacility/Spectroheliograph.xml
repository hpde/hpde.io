      <Description>The National Solar Observatory's Evans Solar Facility 
is at Sacramento Peak, Sunspot, New Mexico.  ESF is two telescopes in one, 
both tracking the solar cycle. A 16" coronagraphic telescope maps magnetic 
changes in the Sun's outer atmosphere. A special set of 12" coelostat 
optics "squints" so the Sun appears as a pinpoint, allowing an "apples 
and apples" comparison with the cycles of distant stars. The 
spectroheliograph is basically a specially designed camera that scans 
across an image of the sun, while letting only light from one particular 
color fall onto a light detector, such as film. It is possible for the 
spectroheliograph to pass light produced from the hydrogen or calcium 
atoms of the sun, for example. Because of the temperature and density 
variation with height in the solar atmosphere, and the resulting offset 
in differents types of atoms, the solar atmospheric structure at 
different heights can can be observed.  See http://nsosp.nso.edu/esf/
