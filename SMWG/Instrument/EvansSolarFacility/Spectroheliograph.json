        "Description": "The National Solar Observatory's Evans Solar Facility \r\nis at Sacramento Peak, Sunspot, New Mexico.  ESF is two telescopes in one, \r\nboth tracking the solar cycle. A 16\" coronagraphic telescope maps magnetic \r\nchanges in the Sun's outer atmosphere. A special set of 12\" coelostat \r\noptics \"squints\" so the Sun appears as a pinpoint, allowing an \"apples \r\nand apples\" comparison with the cycles of distant stars. The \r\nspectroheliograph is basically a specially designed camera that scans \r\nacross an image of the sun, while letting only light from one particular \r\ncolor fall onto a light detector, such as film. It is possible for the \r\nspectroheliograph to pass light produced from the hydrogen or calcium \r\natoms of the sun, for example. Because of the temperature and density \r\nvariation with height in the solar atmosphere, and the resulting offset \r\nin differents types of atoms, the solar atmospheric structure at \r\ndifferent heights can can be observed.
