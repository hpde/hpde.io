        "Description": "The Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer (SOPA) consists\nof three nearly identical silicon solid state detector telescopes, pointed\nat 30, 90, and 120 degrees to the satellite's earth-centered spin axis.\nThe working end of the telescope consists of a very thin front silicon\ndetector, D1, followed by a thick back detector, D2. The D1 sensors are\nmounted with the thin aluminum contact out. The thinner than usual Al\ncontact was chosen to minimize the entrance deadlayer to allow as low a\nproton threshold as possible. Measurements show that the deadlayer is\napproximately 30 micrograms/cm**2. The detector stack is surrounded,\nexcept for the aperture, by passive low-Z (aluminum) and high-A (copper)\nshielding, which excludes side-penetrating protons up to about 65 MeV and\nelectrons up to 6 MeV. The front collimator baffle is designed to require\nat least two-fold scattering of particles not in the acceptance angle of\nthe detector to encounter the D1 detector. This provides an extremely\nsharp angular cutoff of incident particles. The full acceptance angle of\nthe telescopes is about 11 degrees. Each telescope has a geometrical\nfactor of 8.49 E-4 cm**2 sr for ions, and 1.09 E-3 cm**2 sr for low-energy\nelectrons.  A single rotation requires about 10 s, and in that time,\n64 cuts of the unit sphere are taken by the three telescopes in a certain\npattern. Passive cooling keeps the telescope temperatures within the range\n-15 to +5 C. In this range, essentially all of the noise associated with\nleakage current in the surface barrier detectors is eliminated. Even so,\nthe high capacitance of the D1 sensors (~500 pF) requires setting the\nfirst energy threshold relatively high. The numerous thresholds and logic\nchannels (including anti-coincidence) result in identification of\ndifferential fluxes of protons from 50 KeV to 50 MeV. Differential fluxes\nof electrons are determined from 50 KeV to 1.5 MeV, with integral flux\nabove 1.5 MeV. The differential flux range for alpha particles is\n0.5--1.3 MeV; for CNO, 1.5--3.55 MeV; for carbon, 5.0--13 MeV; for\nnitrogen, 6.0--14 MeV; and for oxygen, 7.2--15 MeV. Integral ion fluxes\nare determined for sulphur above 8 MeV, and for bromine above 15 MeV.\nA sun sensor with three collimators that overlap the fields-of-view of\nthe three telescopes provides input to tag the pulse pairs that are\npotentially contaminated by sun-generated pulses from D1.
