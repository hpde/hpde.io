        "Description": "The Magnetospheric Plasma Analyzer (MPA) consists\nof a single electrostatic analyzer (ESA) coupled to an array of channel\nelectron multipliers, and it measures three-dimensional energy/charge\ndistributions of both ions and electrons in a range of ~1 eV/q to\n>40 KeV/q. For use at synchronous orbit, the instrument was designed\nfor high sensitivity with moderate energy and angular resolutions. The\nESA is composed of a set of spherical plates such that the bending\nangle from the center of the entrance aperture is a constant 60 degrees,\nindependent of the polar angle of entry. Electrons and ions are analyzed\nalternately with this single ESA. After leaving the ESA, the particles\nare accelerated into an array of six spiral-configuration channel\nelectron multipliers (CEMs).  Each CEM covers a separate polar angle\nfield of view (FOV). The FOVs are fan-shaped and centered at +/- 11.5,\n34.5, and 57.5 degrees polar angle, where 90 degrees is the spin axis\ndirection (actively controlled to point to the center of the earth).\nThree-dimensional measurements are obtained by using spacecraft rotation,\nat a nominal 6 rpm, to sweep the FOV through the full 360 degree range of\nspacecraft azimuth angle while recording counts in the six polar angle\nFOVs. Measurements are made in standard cycles at each of 24 angles (15\ndegree spacing) in azimuth during each 10 s spacecraft revolution.\nApproximately 92% of the unit sphere is observed by the MPA. Normal\ninstrument operation is composed of five types of cycles arranged in an\neight-cycle sequence that repeats every 86 s. This provides both two-\ndimensional and three-dimensional distributions, with varying resolutions.\nFor more details of the instrument, see the paper by S. J. Bame et al.,\nRev. Sci. Instrum., 64, (4), pp. 1026-1033, 1993.",
