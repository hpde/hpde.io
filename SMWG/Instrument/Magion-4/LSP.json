        "Description": "The Langmuire Slit Probe is used to measure two components of the current density in space. The input signal frequency range is 0.3 Hz to 50 kHz. The output 1 has a linear characteristic over the whole frequency range; in output 2 the characteristic is proportional to the frequency in the range 15 to 1000 Hz.\nThe noise threshold normalized to the input is 10^-13 A/cm^2. The dynamical range of the input signal variations is 80 dB for the first output. The dynamical range is measured from the noise level for a given frequency band to the maximum signal on the detector input. The gain is 70 +/- 10 for output 1 and 3500 +/- 500 for output 2. To calculate the transmission coefficient Ct for a parameter under measurement one should multiply these values by 42.45 V m/kA cm^2.",
