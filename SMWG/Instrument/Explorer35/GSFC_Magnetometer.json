        "Description": "Each sensor of the GSFC-supplied, boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate\nmagnetometer had dual ranges of minus to plus 24 nT and 64 nT, with digitization\nresolutions of minus to plus 0.094 nT and 0.25 nT, respectively. Zero level drift\nwas checked by periodic reorientation of the sensors until May 20, 1969, when the\nflipper mechanism failed. Past this point, data analysis was more difficult as the\nzero level drift of the sensor parallel to the spacecraft spin axis was not readily\ndetermined. Spacecraft interference was less than 0.125 nT. One vector measurement\nwas obtained each 5.12 s. The bandpass of the magnetometer was 0 to 5 Hz, with a\n20-dB per decade decrease for higher frequencies. Except for the flipper failure,\nthe experiment functioned normally from launch to spacecraft turnoff (June 24, 1973).\nFor further details, see Ness et al., J. Geophys. Res., v. 72, p. 5769, 1969.\nThere was also a NASA/ARC-supplied magnetometer on Explorer 35.\n",
