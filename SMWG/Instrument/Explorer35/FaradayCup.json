        "Description": "A multigrid, split-collector Faraday cup mounted\non the equator of the lunar-orbiting Explorer 35 spacecraft was used\nto study the directional intensity of solar wind positive ions and\nelectrons with particular emphasis on the interaction of the solar\nwind with the moon. Twenty-seven integral current samples (requiring\nabout 4.3 s) were taken in an energy-per-charge window from 80 to 2850 eV.\nThen the current was sampled in eight differential energy-per-charge windows\nbetween 50 and 5400 eV at the azimuth where the peak current appeared\nin the previous series of integral measurements. These measurements\n(integral and differential) took about 25 s. Both the sum and\ndifference of collector currents were obtained for positive ions.\nOnly the sum was obtained for electrons. A complete set of measurements\n(two collector plate sums and one difference for protons, and one\ncollector plate sum for electrons) required 328 s. The experiment\nworked well from launch until its failure in July 1968. For further\ndetails, see Lyon et al., J. Geophys. Res., v. 72, p. 6113, 1967.\n",
