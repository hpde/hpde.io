        "Description": "The Cluster team at the Joint Science Operations Centre (JSOC), located at RAL (UK), generates the payload operation plan and translates it into a set of telecommands, to be uplinked to the spacecraft. This activity is performed in coordination with the PI teams and ESA's European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) located in Darmstadt (Germany). The JSOC also monitor the accuracy of the models used to generate predicted planning data, as well as disseminating planning information.",
