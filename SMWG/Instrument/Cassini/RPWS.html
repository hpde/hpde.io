These tests and calibrations were performed at\n    room temperature (25 deg C), -20 deg C, and 40 deg C. While there are\n    calibration signals available in the instrument for in-flight\n    calibration purposes, these are mainly used to check for drifts due\n    to aging or radiation exposure. The primary calibration information\n    to derive physical units (spectral density, etc.) is derived from\n    the prelaunch tests.\n\n\n  Operational Considerations\n  ==========================\n \n    The different types of receivers used to cover the spectral and\n    temporal range covered by the RPWS does not lend itself to a\n    monolithic, synchronous mode of operation. Nevertheless, to reduce\n    the magnitude of the in-flight operations to an acceptable level\n    requires that many of the measurements be scheduled in a systematic\n    way. The approach is to attempt to acquire survey information in the\n    form of uniform spectral and temporal observations at a low enough\n    data rate, ~1 kbps, to ensure that such coverage is available for\n    the entire Saturnian tour and for a large portion of the cruise and\n    approach to Saturn. The survey data set will support spatial\n    mapping, statistical studies, and studies of dynamical effects in\n    the magnetosphere and their possible correlation with solar wind\n    variations. In addition to the survey information, special\n    observations will be added (sometimes at greatly increased data\n    rates) at specific locations or times to provide enhanced\n    information required by several of the science objectives. The\n    special observations may include full polarization and\n    direction-finding capability or high spectral or temporal resolution\n    observations by the high frequency receiver, wideband measurements\n    at one of the possible bandwidths, acquisition of delta-ne/ne\n    measurements, or intensive wave-normal analysis afforded by\n    acquiring five-channel waveforms on an accelerated schedule. While\n    minimizing the number of different modes in which the instrument is\n    operated both simplifies operations and yields a more manageable\n    data set, flexibility (for example in the duty cycle of wideband\n    measurements) increases the likelihood that enhanced measurements\n    can be integrated successfully with the resource requirements of the\n    other instruments. One of the resources which will be most limited\n    on Cassini is the overall data volume; RPWS requires large data\n    volumes for some of its measurements.\n\n\n  Detectors\n  =========\n \n    The RPWS utilizes three 10-m electric antennas, three magnetic\n    antennas, and a Langmuir probe for detectors.  Three monopole\n    electric field antennas, labeled Eu, Ev, and Ew, are used to provide\n    electric field signals to the various receivers. The physical\n    orientations of these three antennas relative to the x, y, and z\n    axes of the spacecraft are given below. However, the electrical\n    orientations of these are strongly affected by the asymmetric nature\n    of the ground plane of the spacecraft chassis.  These electrical\n    orientations are incorporated into the calibrations, primarily of\n    the High Frequency Receiver.  By electronically taking the\n    difference between the voltages on the Eu and Ev monopoles, these\n    two antennas can be used as a dipole, Ex, aligned along the x axis\n    of the spacecraft.\n\n+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n|    Physical orientations of the electric monopole antennas: |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    Antenna  |  theta (degrees) | phi (degrees)              |\n|        Eu   |     107.5        |   24.8                     |\n|        Ev   |     107.5        |  155.2                     |\n|        Ew   |      37.0        |   90.0                     |\n+-------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n    The angle theta is the polar angle measured from the spacecraft +z\n    axis.  The angle phi is the azimuthal angle, measured from the\n    spacecraft +x axis.\n\n    The tri-axial search coil magnetic antennas, labeled Bx, By, and Bz,\n    are used to detect three orthogonal magnetic components of\n    electromagnetic waves. The search coil axes are aligned along the x,\n    y, and z axes of the spacecraft.\n\n    The spherical Langmuir probe is used for electron density and\n    temperature measurements.  This is extended from the spacecraft in\n    approximately the -x direction, in spacecraft coordinates.\n\n\n  Electronics\n  ===========\n \n    The electronics consists of five receivers. These receivers are\n    connected to the antennas described above by a network of switches.\n    The high frequency receiver (HFR) provides simultaneous auto- and\n    cross-correlation measurements from two selected antennas over a\n    frequency range from 3.5 kHz and 16 MHz. By switching the two inputs\n    of this receiver between the three monopole electric antennas, this\n    receiver can provide direction-of-arrival measurements, plus a full\n    determination of the four Stokes parameters. The high frequency\n    receiver includes a processor that performs all of its digital\n    signal processing, including data compression. The high frequency\n    receiver also includes a sounder transmitter that can be used to\n    transmit short square wave pulses from 3.6 to 115.2 kHz. When used\n    in conjunction with the high frequency receiver, the sounder can\n    stimulate resonances in the plasma, most notably at the electron\n    plasma frequency, thereby providing a direct measurement of the\n    electron number density.  The medium frequency receiver (MFR)\n    provides intensity measurements from a single selected antenna over\n    a frequency range from 24 Hz to 12 kHz. This receiver is usually\n    operated in a mode that toggles every 32 seconds between the Ex\n    electric dipole antenna and the Bx magnetic search coil, thereby\n    providing spectral information for both the electric and magnetic\n    components of plasma waves. The low frequency receiver (LFR)\n    provides intensity measurements from 1 Hz to 26 Hz, typically from\n    the Ex electric dipole antenna and the Bx magnetic antenna. The\n    five-channel waveform receiver (WFR) collects simultaneous waveforms\n    from up to five sensors for short intervals in one of two frequency\n    bands, either 1 to 26 Hz, or 3 Hz to 2.5 kHz. When connected to two\n    electric and three magnetic antennas, this receiver provides wave\n    normal measurements of electromagnetic plasma waves. The wideband\n    receiver is designed to provide nearly continuous wideband waveform\n    measurements over a bandwidth of either 60 Hz to 10.5 kHz, or 800 Hz\n    to 75 kHz. These waveforms can be analyzed on the ground in either\n    the temporal domain, or in the frequency domain (Fourier\n    transformed) to provide high-resolution frequency-time spectrograms.\n    In a special frequency-conversion mode of operation, the high\n    frequency receiver can provide waveforms to the wideband receiver in\n    a 25-kHz bandwidth that is tunable to any frequency between 125 kHz\n    and 16 MHz.\n\n    The Langmuir probe controller is used to sweep the bias voltage of\n    the probe over a range from -32 to +32 V in order to obtain the\n    current-voltage characteristics of the probe, and thereby the\n    electron density and temperature. The controller can also set the\n    bias voltage on the Eu and Ev monopoles over a range from -10 to +10\n    V in order to operate them in a current collection mode for\n    delta-ne/ne measurements.\n\n    The RPWS data processing unit consists of three processors. The\n    first processor, called the low-rate processor, controls all\n    instrument functions, collects data from the high frequency\n    receiver, the medium frequency receiver, the low frequency receiver,\n    and the Langmuir probe, and carries out all communications with the\n    spacecraft Command and Data System (CDS). The second processor,\n    called the highrate processor, handles data from the wideband and\n    five-channel waveform receivers and passes the data along to the\n    low-rate processor for transmission to the CDS. The third processor,\n    called the data compression processor, is primarily used for data\n    compression, but can also perform specialized operations such as\n    on-board dust detection by using waveforms from the wideband\n    receiver.\"\n\n\n",

<h1>Calibration</h1>
<pre><code>An extensive series of amplitude calibrations, frequency responses,
phase calibrations, and instrument performance checks were carried
out on the RPWS prior to launch, both before and after integration
on the spacecraft. These tests and calibrations were performed at
room temperature (25 deg C), -20 deg C, and 40 deg C. While there are
calibration signals available in the instrument for in-flight
calibration purposes, these are mainly used to check for drifts due
to aging or radiation exposure. The primary calibration information
to derive physical units (spectral density, etc.) is derived from
the prelaunch tests.
</code></pre>
<h1>Operational Considerations</h1>
<pre><code>The different types of receivers used to cover the spectral and
temporal range covered by the RPWS does not lend itself to a
monolithic, synchronous mode of operation. Nevertheless, to reduce
the magnitude of the in-flight operations to an acceptable level
requires that many of the measurements be scheduled in a systematic
way. The approach is to attempt to acquire survey information in the
form of uniform spectral and temporal observations at a low enough
data rate, ~1 kbps, to ensure that such coverage is available for
the entire Saturnian tour and for a large portion of the cruise and
approach to Saturn. The survey data set will support spatial
mapping, statistical studies, and studies of dynamical effects in
the magnetosphere and their possible correlation with solar wind
variations. In addition to the survey information, special
observations will be added (sometimes at greatly increased data
rates) at specific locations or times to provide enhanced
information required by several of the science objectives. The
special observations may include full polarization and
direction-finding capability or high spectral or temporal resolution
observations by the high frequency receiver, wideband measurements
at one of the possible bandwidths, acquisition of delta-ne/ne
measurements, or intensive wave-normal analysis afforded by
acquiring five-channel waveforms on an accelerated schedule. While
minimizing the number of different modes in which the instrument is
operated both simplifies operations and yields a more manageable
data set, flexibility (for example in the duty cycle of wideband
measurements) increases the likelihood that enhanced measurements
can be integrated successfully with the resource requirements of the
other instruments. One of the resources which will be most limited
on Cassini is the overall data volume; RPWS requires large data
volumes for some of its measurements.
</code></pre>
<h1>Detectors</h1>
<pre><code>The RPWS utilizes three 10-m electric antennas, three magnetic
antennas, and a Langmuir probe for detectors.  Three monopole
electric field antennas, labeled Eu, Ev, and Ew, are used to provide
electric field signals to the various receivers. The physical
orientations of these three antennas relative to the x, y, and z
axes of the spacecraft are given below. However, the electrical
orientations of these are strongly affected by the asymmetric nature
of the ground plane of the spacecraft chassis.  These electrical
orientations are incorporated into the calibrations, primarily of
the High Frequency Receiver.  By electronically taking the
difference between the voltages on the Eu and Ev monopoles, these
two antennas can be used as a dipole, Ex, aligned along the x axis
of the spacecraft.
</code></pre>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>+-------------------------------------------------------------+</p>
<pre><code>The angle theta is the polar angle measured from the spacecraft +z
axis.  The angle phi is the azimuthal angle, measured from the
spacecraft +x axis.

The tri-axial search coil magnetic antennas, labeled Bx, By, and Bz,
are used to detect three orthogonal magnetic components of
electromagnetic waves. The search coil axes are aligned along the x,
y, and z axes of the spacecraft.

The spherical Langmuir probe is used for electron density and
temperature measurements.  This is extended from the spacecraft in
approximately the -x direction, in spacecraft coordinates.
</code></pre>
<h1>Electronics</h1>
<pre><code>The electronics consists of five receivers. These receivers are
connected to the antennas described above by a network of switches.
The high frequency receiver (HFR) provides simultaneous auto- and
cross-correlation measurements from two selected antennas over a
frequency range from 3.5 kHz and 16 MHz. By switching the two inputs
of this receiver between the three monopole electric antennas, this
receiver can provide direction-of-arrival measurements, plus a full
determination of the four Stokes parameters. The high frequency
receiver includes a processor that performs all of its digital
signal processing, including data compression. The high frequency
receiver also includes a sounder transmitter that can be used to
transmit short square wave pulses from 3.6 to 115.2 kHz. When used
in conjunction with the high frequency receiver, the sounder can
stimulate resonances in the plasma, most notably at the electron
plasma frequency, thereby providing a direct measurement of the
electron number density.  The medium frequency receiver (MFR)
provides intensity measurements from a single selected antenna over
a frequency range from 24 Hz to 12 kHz. This receiver is usually
operated in a mode that toggles every 32 seconds between the Ex
electric dipole antenna and the Bx magnetic search coil, thereby
providing spectral information for both the electric and magnetic
components of plasma waves. The low frequency receiver (LFR)
provides intensity measurements from 1 Hz to 26 Hz, typically from
the Ex electric dipole antenna and the Bx magnetic antenna. The
five-channel waveform receiver (WFR) collects simultaneous waveforms
from up to five sensors for short intervals in one of two frequency
bands, either 1 to 26 Hz, or 3 Hz to 2.5 kHz. When connected to two
electric and three magnetic antennas, this receiver provides wave
normal measurements of electromagnetic plasma waves. The wideband
receiver is designed to provide nearly continuous wideband waveform
measurements over a bandwidth of either 60 Hz to 10.5 kHz, or 800 Hz
to 75 kHz. These waveforms can be analyzed on the ground in either
the temporal domain, or in the frequency domain (Fourier
transformed) to provide high-resolution frequency-time spectrograms.
In a special frequency-conversion mode of operation, the high
frequency receiver can provide waveforms to the wideband receiver in
a 25-kHz bandwidth that is tunable to any frequency between 125 kHz
and 16 MHz.

The Langmuir probe controller is used to sweep the bias voltage of
the probe over a range from -32 to +32 V in order to obtain the
current-voltage characteristics of the probe, and thereby the
electron density and temperature. The controller can also set the
bias voltage on the Eu and Ev monopoles over a range from -10 to +10
V in order to operate them in a current collection mode for
delta-ne/ne measurements.

The RPWS data processing unit consists of three processors. The
first processor, called the low-rate processor, controls all
instrument functions, collects data from the high frequency
receiver, the medium frequency receiver, the low frequency receiver,
and the Langmuir probe, and carries out all communications with the
spacecraft Command and Data System (CDS). The second processor,
called the highrate processor, handles data from the wideband and
five-channel waveform receivers and passes the data along to the
low-rate processor for transmission to the CDS. The third processor,
called the data compression processor, is primarily used for data
compression, but can also perform specialized operations such as
on-board dust detection by using waveforms from the wideband
receiver.&quot;

The RPWS data processing unit consists of three processors. The
first processor, called the low-rate processor, controls all
instrument functions, collects data from the high frequency
receiver, the medium frequency receiver, the low frequency receiver,
and the Langmuir probe, and carries out all communications with the
spacecraft Command and Data System (CDS). The second processor,
called the highrate processor, handles data from the wideband and
five-channel waveform receivers and passes the data along to the
low-rate processor for transmission to the CDS. The third processor,
called the data compression processor, is primarily used for data
compression, but can also perform specialized operations such as
on-board dust detection by using waveforms from the wideband
receiver.&quot;
