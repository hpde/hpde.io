        "Description": "\"Objective: To detect the flux of visible light at wavelengths near 486.1 nm during a relativistic electron precipitation event. This will determine whether there are protons accompanying the precipitating electrons. (emissions near 486.1 nm are a signature of precipitating protons.) Correlated proton and relativistic electron precipitation would support scattering by EMIC (electromagnetic ion cyclotron) waves at the precipitation mechanism.\" (Ref. 1)  \"How it works:  The photons are collected through a collimator tube that restricts the field of view to a cone approximately five degrees full width angle, tilted at 35 degrees from the zenith. A 2.5 nm wide Hβ filter is mounted near the base of the collimator. Each photon incident on the two inch diameter photomultiplier tube results in the generation of a charge pulse. These pulses then go into a charge-sensitive pre-amplifier, discriminator, and shaping electronics, producing a TTL pulse for each incident photon. By counting the number of pulses, the flux of the precipitating protons can be determined.\" (Ref. 1)",
