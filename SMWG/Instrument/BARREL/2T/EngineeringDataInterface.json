        "Description": "This document describes the BARREL Balloon 2T Engineering Data Interface.\n\nThe BARREL Balloon 2T EDI performs analog to digital conversion, ADC, of key temperatures, voltages, and currents. There are eight inputs of voltage and current pairs, four inputs of voltage only and sixteen inputs nominally for temperature sensors. Temperature inputs can also be configured to monitor voltage. All inputs are scaled to the nominal 5 V ADC, full-scale range and converted two channels at a time with 16-bit precision.",
