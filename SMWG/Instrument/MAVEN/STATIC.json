        "Description": "The SupraThermal And Thermal Ion Composition, STATIC, Instrument is designed to characterize Ions escaping from the Martian Atmosphere and the Processes of Escape, to determine the Composition of Thermal Ions to Energetic Ions, and the Energy Distributions and Pitch Angle Variations. The Objectives are to measure Ionospheric Ions from 0.1 eV to 10 eV, Tail Superthermal Ions from 5 eV to 100 eV, and Pick-Up Ions from 100 eV to 20 keV, with particular emphasis on the positive Ions of Hydrogen, H, Oxygen, O₂, and iCarbon Dioxide, CO₂. STATIC is a toroidal Electrostatic Analyzer with a Time-of-Flight Section.\n\nThe Instrument consists of an Analyzer/Deflector, which selects the Ions by Energy, a 15 kV Accelerator, and a Series of Carbon Foils with Densities from 0.5 µgm/cm² to 1.1 µgm/cm² backed by a MicroChannel Plate, MCP, Detector. Ions penetrating the first Foil, designated \"Start\", produce Electrons which are accelerated and deflected to the MCP. The next Foil, designated \"Stop\", is 2 cm away, Ions penetrating this Foil produce Electrons which are accelerated by 10 kV through the third Foil, designated \"Thick\", to the MCP. The Thick Foil captures any Protons that have penetrated the Stop Foil. All MCP events are recorded and stored by a Digital Interface Board. STATIC can cover a Mass Range of 1 amu to 70 amu, Flow Velocities from less than 1 km/s to greater than 25 km/s, and an Energy Range from 1 eV to 30 keV. Mounted on the articulating Payload Platform, its Field of View is 360° × 90°.",
