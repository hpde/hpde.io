        "Description": "This experiment was designed to determine the isotopic abundance in the primary cosmic rays for hydrogren through nickel. The instrument used a 10-element solid-state particle telescope consisting of lithium-drifted silicon detectors. Energy ranges measured ran from approximately 20 to approximately 500 MeV/nucleon.  The direction of incident nuclei was obtained from a six-plane drift chamber with 2-deg resolution.",
