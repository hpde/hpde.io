        "Description": "This experiment used a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer. Each sensor\n       had dual ranges of minus to plus 32 nT and 128 nT and digitization errors of\n       minus to plus 0.16 and 0.64 nT, respectively. The operating range could be\n       changed by ground command. The sensor parallel to the spin axis was on a 1.8-m\n       boom and was flipped every 3.9 d to check the zero level. The other two sensors\n       were on a separate boom. Vector measurements were returned each 2.56 s. An\n       onboard autocorrelation computer was included. Autocorrelation data based on\n       240 samplings were returned on alternate components each 20.45 s. The experiment\n       worked well throughout the life of the spacecraft. However, failure of the\n       spacecraft optical aspect system on March 4, 1969, rendered impossible the\n       determination of the magnetic field direction over the last 2 months of data\n       acquisition. For further details, see Fairfield, J. Geophys. Res., v. 74, p.\n       3541, 1969. NSSDC has all the useful data that now exist from this investigation.\n       Hourly averaged interplanetary data also exist as part of data sets in the NSSDC\n       supplementary data file.        \n",
