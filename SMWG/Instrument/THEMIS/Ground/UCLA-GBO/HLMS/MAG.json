        "Description": " The magnetometer is at the THEMIS/Anchorage station. This magnetometer was produced at UCLA. The THEMIS network of ground magnetometers (GMAGS) consists of 28 stations in the Northern United States and Canada. Ten of these systems were installed as part of the Ground-Based Observatory (GBO) systems for THEMIS. Eleven are installed in schools and are part of the THEMIS Education and Public Outreach (E/PO) program (GEONS). The GBO and GEONS networks use the same type of fluxgate magnetometer that measures the vector magnetic field with 0.01 nT resolution at 2 samples/second.\n",
