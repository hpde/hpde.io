        "Description": "The magnetometer at the THEMIS/Carson City station.  This is an Educational Public Outreach magnetometer operated by the NASA THEMIS mission.  EPO magnetometers should be used carefully, as they may be subject to environmental noise. This magnetometer was produced at UCLA.  It records 3-axis magnetic field measurements at 2Hz frequency.",
