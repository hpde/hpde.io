        "Description": "The magnetic field instrument consists of two three-axis flux-gate magnetometers, one mounted at the end of a\n                1.8-m boom, the other 50 cm further inboard, to reduce (and determine) the amount of interference from the spacecraft.\n                The sampling rate is 128 vectors/second when only one of the magnetometers is utilized, and 64 vectors/second when both\n                are utilized. Resolution is 16 bits, and ranges can be selected (automatically or manually) in steps of 4, between 250\n                and 64000 nT.\n",
