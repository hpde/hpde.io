      <Description>The SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory) HMI
(Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager) studies the origin of solar 
variability by characterizing and developing an understanding 
of the sun's interior and the various components of its magnetic 
activity. It extends the capabilities of the SOHO/MDI instrument 
to continuous full-disk coverage at higher spatial resolution 
and vector magnetograms.

HMI observes the full solar disk in the Fe I absorption line at 
6173A with a resolution of 1 arc-second. HMI consists of a 
refracting telescope, a polarization selector, an image 
stabilization system, a narrow band tunable filter and two 4096 
pixel CCD cameras with mechanical shutters and control electronics. 
The continuous data rate is 55Mbits/s. Images are made in a 
sequence of tuning and polarizations at a 4-second cadence for each 
camera. One camera is dedicated to a 45s Doppler and line-of-sight 
field sequence while the other to a 90s vector field sequence. All 
of the images are downlinked for processing at the HMI/AIA Joint 
Science Operations Center at Stanford University.
