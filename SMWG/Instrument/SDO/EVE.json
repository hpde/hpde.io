        "Description": "The SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory) EVE\nExtremeUltraviolet Variability Experiment) measures the solar\nextreme ultraviolet irradiance variations based on the Sun's\nmagnetic features. With improved spectral resolution,\ntemporal cadence, accuracy, and precision, data will\nsupersede measurements made by TIMED SEE, SOHO and SORCE XPS.\nIt helps scientists to understand the Sun's role in driving\nthe outer atmosphere of Earth. The EUV radiation includes\nthe 0.1-105 nm range, which provides the majority of the\nenergy for heating Earth's thermosphere and creating Earth's\nionosphere. This wide spectral range requires the use of\nmultiple channels. Some key requirements for EVE are to\nmeasure the solar EUV irradiance spectrum with 0.1 nm\nspectral resolution and with 20 sec cadence. These drive the\nEVE design to include grating spectrographs with array\ndetectors so that all EUV wavelengths can be measured\nsimultaneously. Another key requirement for EVE is to\nmeasure the EUV radiation with an accuracy of 25% or better,\nthus on-board calibration channels are included to go with\nunderflight calibration experiments to be conducted during\nthe SDO mission.\n\nThe EVE instrument is a fairly large instrument with its\nsize being 100 cm (39\") long by 61 cm (24\") wide by 36 cm\n(14\") high and weighing 61 kg (135 lbs). Its average power\nis 60 Watts, but can peak up to 137 Watts. The engineering\ndata are output at a low rate of 2 kilobits per sec (kbps),\nbut the science data rate is at 7 megabits per sec (Mbps)\nin order to download both MEGS CCD images every 10 seconds.\n\nThere are three instrument subsystems, MEGS, ESP, and EEB:\n\n1. MEGS (Multiple Euv Grating Spectrograph): set of 2\nRowland-circle grating spectrographs that measure the\n5-105 nm spectral irradiance with 0.1 nm spectral\nresolution and with 10-second cadence. Each spectrograph\nuses a back-illuminated 2048 x 1024 CCD camera from MIT\nLincoln Laboratory. The CCD Electronics Box (CEB) is also\npart of MEGS. MEGS has 4 channels: MEGS-A: grazing incidence\ngrating spectrograph for 5 nm to 37 nm range; MEGS-B: double\nnormal-incidence grating spectrograph for 35 nm to 105 nm;\nMEGS-SAM: pinhole camera used with MEGS-A CCD to measure\nindividual X-ray photons in the 0.1 nm to 7 nm range;\nMEGS-P: photodiode used with the first grating in MEGS-B\nto measure the bright H I Lyman-alpha emission\n\n2. ESP (Euv SpectroPhotometer): transmission grating\nspectrograph that measures 4 bands in the 17-38 nm range\nand also 0.1-7 nm in zeroth order. ESP provides calibrations\nfor MEGS sensitivity changes and higher time cadence\n(0.25-second). The ESP is very similar to the SOHO SEM\ninstrument.\n\n3. EEB (EVE Electronics Box): electronics that control the\nMEGS and ESP instruments and provides an interface to/from\nthe SDO spacecraft.\n",
