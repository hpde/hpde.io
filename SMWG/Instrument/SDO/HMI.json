        "Description": "The SDO (Solar Dynamics Observatory) HMI\n(Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager) studies the origin of solar \nvariability by characterizing and developing an understanding \nof the sun's interior and the various components of its magnetic \nactivity. It extends the capabilities of the SOHO/MDI instrument \nto continuous full-disk coverage at higher spatial resolution \nand vector magnetograms.\n\nHMI observes the full solar disk in the Fe I absorption line at \n6173A with a resolution of 1 arc-second. HMI consists of a \nrefracting telescope, a polarization selector, an image \nstabilization system, a narrow band tunable filter and two 4096 \npixel CCD cameras with mechanical shutters and control electronics. \nThe continuous data rate is 55Mbits/s. Images are made in a \nsequence of tuning and polarizations at a 4-second cadence for each \ncamera. One camera is dedicated to a 45s Doppler and line-of-sight \nfield sequence while the other to a 90s vector field sequence. All \nof the images are downlinked for processing at the HMI/AIA Joint \nScience Operations Center at Stanford University.\n",
