        "Description": "The Low Frequency Atmospheric Weather Electromagnetic\n   System for Observation, Modeling, and Education, or LF AWESOME is a\n   high-sensitivity radio receiver for the frequency band 0.5-470 kHz.\n   The receiver is an upgraded version of the VLF AWESOME, completed\n   in 2004, which provided high sensitivity broadband radio\n   measurements of natural lightning emissions, transmitting beacons,\n   and radio emissions from the near-Earth space environment.  LF\n   AWESOME is a significant upgrade to the VLF AWESOME, in which the\n   frequency range has been extended to include the LF and part of the\n   medium frequency (MF) bands, the sensitivity improved by 10-25 dB\n   to be as low as 0.03 fT/ sqrt(Hz), depending on the frequency, and\n   timing error reduced to 15-20 ns range. The expanded capabilities\n   allow detection of radio atmospherics from lightning strokes at\n   global distances and multiple traverses around the world. It also\n   allows monitoring of transmitting beacons in the LF/MF band at\n   thousands of km distance. (from the abstract of the LF AWESOME\n   instrument paper)",
