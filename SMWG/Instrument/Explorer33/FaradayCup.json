        "Description": "A split-collector Faraday cup mounted on the\nspacecraft equator was used to study the directional intensity of\nsolar wind ions and electrons. The following 25-s sequence was executed\nthree times for ions and once for electrons each 328 s. Twenty-seven\ndirectional current samples from the two collectors were taken in the\nenergy per charge (E/Q) window from 80 to 2850 eV. The currents in the\ntwo collectors were then sampled in eight E/Q windows between 50 and\n5400 eV at the azimuth at which peak current appeared in the previous 27\nmeasurements. Due to telemetry limitations, only the following data were\nreturned to earth every 328 s: for ions, the sums of currents measured on\nthe two collector plates twice and the difference once, and for electrons,\nthe sums once. The experiment worked well from launch until the final\nspacecraft data transmission in October, 1971. For further details,\nsee Lyon et al., J. Geophys. Res., v. 72, p. 6113, 1967.\n",
