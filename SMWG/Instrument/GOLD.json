        "Description": "The Global-scale Observations of the Limb and Disk (GOLD) mission \n\t  is a heliophysics Mission of Opportunity for NASA’s Explorers program. GOLD is \n\t  intended to perform a two-year mission imaging Earth's thermosphere and ionosphere \n\t  from geostationary orbit. GOLD is a two-channel far-ultraviolet (FUV) imaging \n\t  spectrograph built by the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the \n\t  University of Colorado Boulder and flown as a hosted payload on the commercial \n\t  communications satellite SES-14.\n\t  \n\t  The scientific objectives of the GOLD mission are to determine how geomagnetic \n\t  storms alter the temperature and composition of Earth’s atmosphere, to analyze \n\t  the global-scale response of the thermosphere to solar extreme-ultraviolet variability, \n\t  to investigate the significance of atmospheric waves and tides propagating from \n\t  below the temperature structure of the thermosphere and to resolve how the structure \n\t  of the equatorial ionosphere influences the formation and evolution of equatorial \n\t  plasma density irregularities. The viewpoint provided by GOLD’s geostationary \n\t  orbit – from which the same hemisphere is always observable – is a new perspective \n\t  on the Earth’s upper atmosphere. This viewpoint allows local time, universal time \n\t  and longitudinal variations of the thermosphere and ionosphere's response to the \n\t  various forcing mechanisms to be uniquely determined.\n\t  ",
