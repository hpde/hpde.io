        "Description": "The objectives of this investigation are studies of\n(1) the large scale configuration of the electric field in the magnetotail,\n(2) tail electric field variations during substorms, (3) the electric\nfield in the plasma sheet, (4) the electric field near the magnetopause\nand in the plasma mantle at locations tailward of those covered by similar\nmeasurements on ISEE 1, (5) micropulsation and low frequency wave\nmeasurements at frequencies covering the local gyrofrequency (.LT.1Hz) and\nlower hybrid frequency (.LT.10Hz) in the tail, (6) plasma density as deduced\nfrom measurement of the floating potential of the spacecraft, and\n(7) electric field comparisons (with the aid of the other spacecraft in\nthe ISTP program) at different points along the same magnetic field line,\nat different points along a common boundary, or in different regions of\nthe magnetosphere. The instrument consists of two orthogonal double probes,\neach of which is a pair of separated spheres on wire booms that are\nlocated in the satellite spin plane and whose difference of potential is\nmeasured. The separation distances between the pair of sensors are variable\nand as great as 160 m tip-to-tip. One operating mode involves length ratios\nof the two antennas of about 2:1 in order to verify instrument operation\nthrough showing that the electric field signature is proportional to the\nboom length. A second reason for two pairs of wire booms in the satellite\nspin plane is the requirement for measurements having a time resolution far\nbetter than the satellite spin period.",
