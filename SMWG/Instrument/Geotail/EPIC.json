        "Description": "The principal objective of the EPIC (Energetic \nParticles and Ion Composition) investigation is to explore the \nouter magnetosphere and the distant magnetotail region and obtain \ninformation on the origin, transport, storage, acceleration and \ndynamics of suprathermal and non-thermal particle populations. \nThe instrument contains two main sensor heads. The STICS assembly \n(Supra-Thermal Ion Composition Spectrometer) uses a quadrispherical \nelectrostatic analyzer followed by a foil/solid state detector \ntime-of-flight (TOF) telescope to measure charge state, mass and \nenergy of ions with energies of 10 - 230 keV/charge. The ICS \nassembly (Ion Composition Subsystem) measures the mass and energy \nof energetic ions with energies of less than 50 keV to 3 MeV. It \nuses a pair of collimators with sweeping magnets to reject \nelectrons, followed by TOF and energy analysis. A thin foil/solid \nstate detector electron telescope measures electrons higher than \n30 keV. Directional measurements with a time resolution less than\n3 s for all species are possible. A detailed instrument description, \nand a complete set of EPIC summary plots from launch to the present, \nplus on-line access to the digital data set, is available at the \nEPIC link below.",
