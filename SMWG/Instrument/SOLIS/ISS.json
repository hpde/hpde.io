        "Description": "The SOLIS Integrated Sunlight Spectrometer (ISS) is designed\nto obtain both high (R = 300,000) and moderate (R = 30,000) spectral resolution\nobservations of the Sun as a star. ISS provides observations of disk-integrated\nsunlight through the use of a fiber optic feed. A small optical system utilizing\na lens of 8-mm diameter will focus a 400 micron diameter image of the Sun on the\ninput face of the fiber. The output beam from the fiber will consist of sunlight\nscrambled in both angle and position so that any output angle from any position\non the exit face will be well-integrated.  A prism pre-disperser will isolate\nthe desired wavelength band. The McPherson 2-m Czerny-Turner spectrograph in\nthe ISS employs a 316 g/mm grating blazed at 63.5 degrees. The focal plane\ndetector is a movable, back-illuminated 1024 X 256 CCD.  Among the many\nwavelengths measured are the Ca II H and K lines at 396.8 and 393.4 nm,\nHe I 1083 nm, H-alpha 656.3 nm, and the Ca II triplet at 854.2 nm.",
