        "Description": "An omnidirectional gamma-ray detector employing two Phoswich scintillation spectrometers sensitive to photons from 0.2 to 2.0 MeV was used with logic circuitry to detect the beginning of a gamma event and to initiate a period of rapid data collection. Data were stored in a memory unit for subsequent transmission to earth. Confirmation that a true gamma event had occurred was obtained by comparison with results from other experiments in earth satellites. This experiment provided long-baseline time correlations necessary for calculating accurate source locations.",
