        "Description": "The primary SC1 science experiment is the VLF wave experiment. The experiment employs two antennas, an air-core loop and the 100 m tip-to-tip dipole from the SC10 experiment. The electric field receiver has a sensitivity of 5x10^-7 V/(mHz^.5) at 1.3 kHz and 10^-7 V/(mHz^.5) at 10.5 kHz.  The magnetic loop is electrostatically shielded, has an effective area of 575 m^2 at 1.3 kHz, and is mounted on a two-meter boom.  The sensitivity of the magnetic receiver is 3 x 10^-6 gamma/Hz^.5 at 1.3 kHz and has a 60 dB dynamic range.  There are eight narrow band filter (bandwidth +/- 7.5%) outputs at 0.4, 1.3, 2.3, 3.0, 10.5, 30.0, 100.0 and 300.0 kHz and a broadband mode (0 to 5 kHz). The broadband data is taken for one to two hours per day.",
