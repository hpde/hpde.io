        "Description": "The objective of the experiment (E8) was to study the origin\nand the distribution mechanism of low-energy electrons and protons. The\ninstrument, a magnetic spectrometer, consisted of six semiconductor detectors\nwith the field of view in the plane of the ecliptic. Species separation was\nachieved by an inhomogeneous magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the\nparticle path. Four electron and two proton detectors measured electrons\nfrom 17 to 835 keV and protons from 21 to 677 keV. The proton measurements\nwere made with a two-detector telescope employing coincidence and anticoincidence\nlogic. Both particle species were measured in 16 energy channels through\npulse-height analysis. For further information see pp. 261-263 of\nRaumfahrtforschung, v. 19, n. 5, 1975.",
