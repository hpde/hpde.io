        "Description": "\n        The Plasma Wave Instrument (PWI) measured ac electric fields\n        over the frequency range from 1 Hz to 2 MHz, and an amplitude\n        range of 0.03 microvolt per meter to 100 mV per meter. Magnetic\n        fields were measured from 1 Hz to 400 kHz over an approximately\n        100-dB range.\n       \n        The objectives of this investigation were to\n        measure the spatial, temporal, spectral, and wave\n        characteristics (particularly the Poynting vector component\n        along the magnetic field line) and the wave polarization for\n        extremely-low-frequency (ELF), very-low-frequency (VLF), and\n        high-frequency (HF) noise phenomena. Of special interest were\n        the auroral kilometric radiation and VLF hiss, and a variety of\n        electrostatic waves that may cause field-aligned acceleration of\n        particles.\n       \n        The investigation made use of the long dipole\n        antennas in the spin plane and along the Z axis, and a magnetic\n        loop antenna. A single-axis search coil magnetometer and a short\n        electric antenna were included for low-frequency measurements\n        and electrostatic noise measurements at short wavelengths.\n       \n        The electronics consisted of\n       \n        * (1) a wideband/long baseline receiver\n        with a bandwidth of 10 or 40 kHz in the range 0-2 MHz;\n        * (2) a step-frequency correlator, containing two sweep-frequency\n        receivers and phase detectors, sweeping 100 Hz to 400 kHz in 32\n        s, and giving the phase between magnetic and electric components\n        of the field;\n        * (3) a low-frequency correlator containing two\n        filter receivers and phase detectors (eight filters in the range\n        1.78-100 Hz). The sweep rate is 8 s/spectra at the high frequency end\n        (above 18 Hz); it is 32 s/spectra for frequencies for 1.8-10 Hz;\n        * (4) dc monitors that measured\n        the voltage difference between the two sets of long dipole\n        antennas; and\n        * (5) a linear wave receiver, selectable from\n        1.5 to 3.0, 3 to 6, or 10 to 16 kHz bands.\n       \n        The wideband receiver\n        was flown to transmit wideband waveform signals to the ground\n        via an analog transmitter, so that detailed high-resolution\n        frequency-time analysis could be performed.\n       \n        Since June 23, 1984\n        a malfunction in the spacecraft data- handling system has\n        prevented access to some PWI data. Digital measurements from the\n        sweep frequency receiver system were no longer accessible.\n       \n        More\n        details are found in S. D. Shawhan et al., Space Sci. Instrum.,\n        v. 5, n. 4, p. 535, 1981.\n",
