        "Description": "\n         This investigation used a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer (MAG-A),\n         similar to one on board DE 2, to obtain vector magnetic\n         field data needed to study the magnetosphere-ionosphere-\n         atmosphere coupling.\n        \n         The primary objective of this\n         investigation was to obtain measurements of field-aligned\n         currents in the auroral oval and over the polar cap at two\n         different altitudes. This was accomplished using the two\n         spacecraft and correlations of these measurements with\n         observations of electric fields, plasma waves, suprathermal\n         particles, thermal particles, and auroral images obtained from\n         investigation 81-070A-03. Ultra low frequency (ULF) waves were\n         also studied.\n        \n         The magnetometer incorporated its own 12-bit\n         analog-to-digital converter, a 4-bit digital compensation\n         register for each axis, and a system control to generate a 48-\n         bit data word consisting of a 16-bit representation of the\n         field measured along each of the three magnetometer axes. Track\n         and hold modules were used to obtain simultaneous samples on\n         all three axes. Instrument bandwidth was 25 Hz. The instrument\n         dynamic range was plus or minus 6.2E4 nT, and the resolution\n         was plus or minus 1.5 nT in the 6.2E4 nT region, plus or minus\n         0.25 nT in the 1.E3 nT region, and plus or minus 0.02 nT in the\n         80 nT region. The magnetometer's digital compensation of the\n         ambient field was nominally in 8.E3 nT increments.\n        \n         Further\n         details are in W. H. Farthing et al., Space Sci. Instrum., v.\n         5, n. 4, p. 551, 1981.\n",
