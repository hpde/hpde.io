        "Description": "The Coupled Ion-Neutral Dynamics Investigation (CINDI) payload is funded by NASA as an Explorer Mission of Opportunity. CINDI consists of two instruments: the Ion Velocity Meter (IVM) and the Neutral Wind Meter (NWM). The IVM instrument includes a ion drift meter (IDM) and a retarding potential analyzer (RPA). IVM measure the ion drift vector, the ion temperature, and the major ion composition with a spatial resolution of about 4 km along the satellite track; the ion drift meter also provides vertical and horizontal ion drift components at 500 m resolution. The NWM consists of a cross track wind sensor and a ram wind sensor providing a direct measure of the neutral wind vector with a spatial resolution of about 8 km along the satellite track. The CINDI homepage is at http://cindispace.utdallas.edu/",
