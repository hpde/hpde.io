        "Description": "\nThe Vector Electric Field Instrument (VEFI) on the Communication/Navigation Outage\nForecasting System (C/NOFS) satellite consists of one central electronics box that\nreceives inputs from three orthogonal 20m tip-to-tip electric field double probe antennas,\na fixed-bias Langmuir probe, a fluxgate magnetometer, and an optical lightning detector.\nAll of the instruments were designed, built, and tested at the Goddard Space Flight Center\nwith the exception of the lightning detector that was designed at the Univ. of Washington,\nand fabricated and tested at Goddard. The VEFI instrument is thus one experiment with many\nsensors to measure the AC and DC electric fields related to plasma shift and irregularity\ndevelopment in the ionosphere.\n",
