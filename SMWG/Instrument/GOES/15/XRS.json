        "Description": "The XRS is an x-ray telescope that observes and measures solar x-ray emissions in two\nrangesâ€”one from 0.05 to 0.3 nanometers (nm) and the second from 0.1 to 0.8 nm. In real-time,\nit measures the intensity and duration of solar flares in order to provide alerts and warnings of\npotential geophysical responses, such as changes in ionospheric conditions, that can disrupt\nradio communications and Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. XRS data is also used to\nestimate solar flare parameters such as rise-time (how quickly a flare grows) and the length and\ntemperature of a flare for use in energetic proton predictions.\n\nThe five-channel EUV telescope is new on the GOES-N,O,P satellites. It measures solar\nextreme ultraviolet energy in five wavelength bands from 10 nm to 126 nm. The EUV sensor\nprovides a direct measure of the solar energy that heats the upper atmosphere and creates the\nionosphere. Changes in solar EUV output can change the density of the upper atmosphere by a\nfactor of 10, which will cause increased drag for satellites in low-Earth-orbit.\nSimilarly, these changes in EUV level can increase the density of the ionosphere by a\nfactor of 10, which will affect radio communications and satellite navigation.\n\nBoth the XRS and EUV are provided by Assurance Technology Corporation, and\nare part of the sun-observing package mounted on the solar panel yoke\nassembly. The entire package (including the SXI) continually points at the sun by\nusing a Precision Sun Sensor (PSS) to control the solar panels to track the sun in\nazimuth and the x-ray positioner (XRP) to track the sun in elevation.",
