        "Description": "Each of the GOES-N,O,P satellites have two identical magnetometers, provided by Science\nApplications International Corporation (SAIC), Inc. in Columbia, Maryland. They can operate\nindependently and simultaneously to measure the magnitude and direction of the Earthâ€™s\ngeomagnetic field, detect variations in the magnetic field near the spacecraft, provide alerts of\nsolar wind shocks or sudden impulses that impact the magnetosphere, and assess the level of\ngeomagnetic activity. Magnetometer data is archived for the scientific community and other\ninterested users. One magnetometer sensor is mounted on the end of the boom 27.9 feet (8.5 m)\nfrom the spacecraft. The other is positioned on the same boom 2.6 feet (0.8 m) closer to the\nspacecraft. The second magnetometer sensor serves as a backup in case the first magnetometer\nsensor fails and provides for better calibration of the magnetometer data channel.",
