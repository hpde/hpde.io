        "Description": "The Space Environment Monitor is a standard package in all GOES missions. It carries an energetic particle sensor (EPS) to obtain the local fluxes of electrons, protons and alpha-particles. Its XRS monitors X-ray flux from the Sun in two wavelength bands: 0.05-0.3 nm and 0.1-0.8 nm. A magnetometer monitors the field vector of the disturbed by geomagnetic activity. A five-channel EUV telescope monitors the solar ultraviolet radiation in the 10-126 nm.",
