        "Description": "This experiment was designed to measure accurately the vector magnetic\n      field in the interplanetary medium and in the earth's magnetosphere, magnetotail,\n      and magnetosheath. The detector was a boom-mounted triaxial fluxgate magnetometer\n      with four ranges: minus to plus 16, 48, 144, and 432 nT, respectively. Corresponding\n      sensitivities were plus or minus 0.06, 0.19, 0.56, and 1.69 nT, respectively.\n      Automatic range selection capability was included. A flipping mechanism permitted\n      inflight calibration of the three sensor zero levels. The vector sampling rate\n      was 12.5 samples per second. The experiment functioned normally through the\n      spacecraft life. For further details, see D. H. Fairfield, J. Geophys. Res.,\n      v. 79, p. 1368, 1974. Hourly averaged interplanetary data also exist as part of\n      data sets in the NSSDC supplementary data file.",
