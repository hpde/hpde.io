        "Description": "The FM-3I instrument consists of two flux-gate magnetometers M1 and M2 covering two different ranges: -200 to +200 nT and -1000 to +1000 nT. The M2 instrument is mostly used to perform the attitude control of the INTERBALL 1 spacecraft. M1 magnetometer data are transmitted to the scientific SSNI telemetry system at rates 0.125-16 vectors/s depending on the instrument operating mode. The magnetic field data from the M2 magnetometer are transmitted at the rate 1 vector per 6 seconds to the BNS attitude control system.\n     \nFM-3 M2 magnetometer failed in February 1996.",
