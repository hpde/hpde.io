        "Description": "The CANOPUS Baristatic Auroral Radar System (BARS) comprosed a ground-based radar array for remote sensing the high latitude ionosphere during the ISTP/GGS program. The system consisted of two 48 MHz coherent radars situated in Nipawin, Saskatchewan and Red Lake, Ontario. These radars illuminated the region roughly defined by the 333.0' and 340.5' EDFL meridians and the 63.0' and 67.8' EDFL latitudes via one broad transmitter beam and receive via 8 contiguous vertical fan beams. These beams plus range gating produced a two dimensional array of backscatter intensity and Doppler shift data. The CANOPUS program has been superseded by the CARISMA (Canadian Array for Realtime Investigations of Magnetic Activity).",
