        "Description": "The ISIS 1 (International Satellites for Ionospheric Studies) Swept-Frequency Sounder measured the\n                ionospheric electron density in the altitude range 300 to 3500 km, and provided correlative data for the other\n                ISIS 1 experiments, particularly those measuring ionospheric parameters. The ionosonde was a radio transmitter\n                that recorded the time delay between a transmitted and returned radio-frequency pulse. A continuum of frequencies\n                between 0.1 and 20 MHz was sampled every 19 or 29 s, and one of six selected frequencies was also used for sounding\n                for a few seconds during each 19- or 29-s period. In addition to the sweep- and fixed-frequency modes of operation,\n                a mixed mode was available in which the transmitter frequency was fixed at one of six possible frequencies while\n                the receiver swept. Several virtual-range (delay-time) traces resulting from ground reflections, plasma resonances,\n                birefringence of the ionosphere, nonvertical propagation, etc., were normally observed.",
