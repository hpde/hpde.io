        "Description": "Two triaxial systems of 127-deg cylindrical\n                electrostatic analyzers were used to make three-dimensional\n                measurements of the electron distribution function. There were\n                three modes of operation, with the following nominal energy ranges:\n                solar wind, 7 to 500 eV; magnetosheath, 10 eV to 2 keV;\n                and magnetotail and solar, 105 eV to 7.05 keV. The energy\n                resolution (delta E/E) was 0.07. The entire set of six simultaneous\n                spectrometer measurements was taken while the satellite rotated\n                through 60 deg. Each spectrometer consisted of a curved-plate\n                analyzer and two channeltron detectors.",
