        "Description": "This instrument produces H-alpha solar imagery from \r\nKanzelhoehe Solar Observatory (KSO), Austria.  Its main purpose is a \r\nhigh precision full disk imaging of the photosphere in order to derive \r\nsunspot and faculae areas and positions as well. Other scientific \r\nobjectives are studies of the underlying photosphere before, during and \r\nafter chromospheric flares, hunting for the mystery white light flares \r\nat the begin of a new solar cycle and providing a data set for \r\ndeveloping an automatic determination of sunspot relative numbers by \r\nimage segmentation techniques. The obtained time series will also \r\ncontinue the support of the Debrecen Photoheliographic Data by daily \r\nsynoptic images.  The Kanzelhoehe Photosphere Telescope (KPT) is based \r\non the Kanzelhöhe Photoheliograph (PhoKa) which went into operation in \r\n1989 and was described in detail in Pettauer, T.: 1990, in L. Deszö (ed.), \r\nThe Dynamic Sun, Publ. Debrecen Heliophysical Observatory, Debrecen, \r\np. 62(1990).  See http://www.kso.ac.at/instrumente/kpt/kpt_en.php\r\nfor further detail.",
