        "Description": "Terminated Folded Dipole and SDRPlay Software Defined\n   Radio spectrograph system at the Hawk's Nest Radio Astronomy Observatory.\nThe TFD is a 4 element (26 foot) square array. Each antenna element is 24\nfeet long. Bandwidth is 15-30 MHz. Polarization is simulataneous RCP\nand LCP. TFD array is aligned to true north. The SDRPlay can be\nselected to detect either RCP or LCP. \n   \n   See the Information URL for a link to a document providing\n   additional descriptions of the instrument characteristics.",
