        "Description": "Terminated Folded Dipole and FSX-8S 12 bit switching\n   dual polarization spectrograph system at the Hawk's Nest Radio Astronomy Observatory.\nThe TFD is a 4 element (26 foot) square array. Each antenna element is 24\nfeet long. Bandwidth is 30 kHz. Polarization is simulataneous RCP\nand LCP. TFD array is aligned to true north. The FSX-8S spectrograph\noperates at 15 -30 MHz simultaneous RCP and LCP.\n   \n   See the Information URL for a link to a document providing\n   additional descriptions of the instrument characteristics.",
