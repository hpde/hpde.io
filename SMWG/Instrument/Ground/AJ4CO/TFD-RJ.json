Each antenna element is 32 feet long. TFD array is aligned to true north. The Dual-Radio JOVE receiver system operates with two separate Radio JOVE receivers at 20.1 MHz providing uncorrelated RCP and LCP.\n\nSee the Information URL for a link to a document providing additional descriptions of the instrument characteristics.",
