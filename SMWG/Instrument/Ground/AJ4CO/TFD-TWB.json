        "Description": "Terminated Folded Dipole and Tunable Wideband Receiver system at the AJ4CO Radio Astronomy Observatory, High Springs, Florida.\n\nThe TFD array consists of two 4-element (32 foot) square array. Each antenna element is 32 feet long. Bandwidth is 2 MHz. Polarization is simulataneous RCP and LCP. TFD array is aligned to true north. The FSX-8S spectrograph operates at 17-33 MHz simultaneous RCP and LCP.\n\nSee the Information URL for a link to a document providing additional descriptions of the instrument characteristics.",
