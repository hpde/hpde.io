        "Description": "The ECHO (Experiment for Coordinated \nHelioseismic Observations) is a network of two instruments which \nobserve solar oscillations as seen in the radial velocity of the \nsolar surface. The ECHO will use the next generation of the LOWL \n[Low degree(L)] instrument, which has been operated at the Mauna Loa \nSolar Observatory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research \nfor the past several years. The first of the new ECHO instruments \nbecame operational on Dec 15, 1999 at the Observatorio del Teide, \nlocated at Izana, Tenerife, Spain. The LOWL instrument at MLSO\nwas upgraded and became the second instrument in the ECHO \nnetwork.  The LOWL observes the oscillations as perturbations of \nthe radial velocity over the surface of the Sun. This is \naccomplished by taking images in narrow bandpass filters \ndisplaced slightly redward and blueward of a solar absorption \nline.",
