        "Description": "\nThe instrument (E2) consisted of a triaxial fluxgate magnetometer mounted on a 2.75-m boom to make magnetic field measurements up to 4 Hz.\nData from each axis were first sent through a low-pass filter with the 3 dB attenuation point at 4 Hz.\nDepending on the telemetry format and bit rate, the data were fed either into a time-averaging computer or directly connected to telemetry.\nWhen there were discontinuities in the variations of the ambient magnetic field, a shock-identification computer triggered the storage of rapid-rate data in the spacecraft memory.\nTwo measurement ranges were used, plus or minus 100 and 400 nT with resolutions of plus or minus 0.2 and 0.8 nT, respectively.\nThe instrument was equipped with a flipper mechanism, which re-oriented each sensor by 90 deg periodically.\nFor detailed information, see p. 232 of Raumfahrtforschung, v. 19, n. 5, 1975.\n      ",
