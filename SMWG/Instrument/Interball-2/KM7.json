        "Description": "The primary purpose of KM-7 is to measure the temperature of cold electrons in the plasmasphere. As an auxiliary parameter, the instrument measures the difference of potentials between the floating spherical probe DET-P and the spacecraft. The spacecraft potential can be evaluated from these measurements. From detailed measurements (only in the STO telemetry mode) the ambient ion density can also be determined.",
