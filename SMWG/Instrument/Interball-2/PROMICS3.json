        "Description": "PROMICS-3 is a plasma experiment and performs three-dimensional measurements of ions in the energy range 4 eV to 70 keV with mass separation (M = 1 - 32), and of electrons in the energy range 12 eV to 35 keV. The instrument uses toroidal electrostatic analyzers. MEPS is the electron spectrometer, and TRICS is the ion mass spectrometer.\nInterball Tail Probe and Interball Auroral Probe both carry identical PROMICS-3 instruments, thus facilitating direct comparisons of the particle distributions.\nSee the web page at http://www.irf.se/rpg/interball.html for further information.\nThe PROMICS-3 instrument was developed in cooperation between the Swedish Institute of Space Physics (IRF), the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI) and the Space Research Institute, Moscow (IKI). The major part of the hardware of PROMICS-3 was designed and built at IRF in Kiruna. Much of the electronics was built in Finland by FMI, Hollming OY, and VTT.",
