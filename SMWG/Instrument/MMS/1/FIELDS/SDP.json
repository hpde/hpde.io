        "Description": "MMS has two double-probe instruments, a Spin-plane Double Probe (SDP) and an Axial Double Probe (ADP). The Spin-plane Double Probe (SDP) consists of four 48-meter wire booms with spherical sensors at the end. The SDP provides full three-dimensional electric field measurements over a range from DC to 100 kHz with an accuracy of 0.5 mV/m. The double-probe instruments were developed by the Swedish Institute of Space Physics, the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology, the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the University of New Hampshire. The SDP is part of the FIELDS suite, which is led by Co-I R. B. Torbert (University of New Hampshire).",
