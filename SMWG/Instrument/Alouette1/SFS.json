        "Description": "The Alouette 1 Sweep-Frequency Sounder measured the ionospheric electron density in the altitude range 300 to 1000 km. The ionosonde was a radio transmitter that recorded the time delay between a transmitted and returned radio-frequency pulse. A continuum of frequencies between 0.5 and 12 MHz was sampled once every 18 s. Several virtual-range (delay-time) traces resulting from ground reflections, plasma resonances, birefringence of the ionosphere, nonvertical propagation, etc., were normally observed.",
