        "Description": "This experiment used two telescopes to measure the composition and energy spectra of solar (and galactic) particles above about 0.5 MeV/nucleon. The main telescope consisted of five collinear elements (three solid state, one CsI, and one sapphire Cerenkov) surrounded by a plastic anticoincidence shield. The telescope had a 60-deg, full-angle acceptance cone with its axis approximately normal to the spacecraft spin axis, permitting eight-sectored information on particle arrival direction. Four elements of the main telescope were pulse-height analyzed, and low- and high-gain modes could be selected by command to permit resolution of the elements H through Ni or of electrons and the isotopes of H and He and light nuclei. A selection-priority scheme was included to permit sampling of less abundant particle species under normal and solar-flare conditions. The low-energy telescope was essentially a two-element shielded solid-state detector with a 70-deg full-angle acceptance cone. The first element was pulse-height analyzed, and data were recorded by sectors.",
