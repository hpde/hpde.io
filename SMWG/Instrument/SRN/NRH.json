        "Description": "The Nancay Radioheliograph (NRH; located at 47 N 02 E) \nprovides since the end of 1996 two dimensional images of the radio \nbrightness of the Sun with second time resolution. It consists of \ntwo linear antenna arrays, on terrestrial east-west and north-south \nbaselines respectively.  In its earlier versions it operated in 1D \nonly at 169 MHz with both arrays from 1980 until early 1985, and \nlater at 164 MHz with the east-west array, and in a five-frequency \nmode with the north-south array from 1986 to 1990. Since late summer \n1991 both arrays of the NRH are operated in the multifrequency mode. \nUp to five frequencies are chosen in the range 150 - 450 MHz within \nthe restrictions imposed by terrestrial interference.  Since the end \nof 1996, N/S and E/W arrays can be correlated in the multifrequency \nmode from 150 to 450 MHz in order to produce 2D radiograms.",
