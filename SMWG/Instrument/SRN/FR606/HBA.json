        "Description": "LOFAR is an interferometer with about 50 000 antennas grouped in 50 stations through \n                Europe, with 60% of them located in the Netherlands. It has been running since 2012. Nan√ßay's \n                LOFAR station is composed of 2 antennas array and one shipment container housing the receptors \n                and the computing systems. It is connected to a central supercomputer in Groningen, Netherlands.\n                The key scientific objectives are deep sky surveys, the study of reionisation epoch, of variable \n                sources like pulsars, jets, eruptive stars, planets and exoplanets, the detection of very high \n                energy cosmic rays, and the interplanetary medium physics.\n                HBA (High Band Array) spectral range: 120 to 240 MHz",
