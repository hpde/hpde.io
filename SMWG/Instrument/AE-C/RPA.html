 		"description": "This experiment was designed to determine vector ion drift velocities, ion concentration and\n   temperature, and spacecraft potential. An ionospheric irregularity index was also obtained from the ion\n   concentration sensor. The experiment consisted of a retarding potential analyzer with four planar sensor\n   heads. The sensor head used for ion drift measurements was co-located with another head, and all were spaced\n   nearly equally, looking outward from the satellite equator. Since the satellite spin axis was perpendicular\n   to the orbit plane, these heads could observe along the spacecraft velocity vector in either the spin or\n   despun mode of the spacecraft. The primary objective of this experiment was to provide accurate ion\n   temperatures with other measurements being of secondary importance. Three of the sensor heads were similar.\n   They had two grounded entrance grids, two retarding grids, a suppressor grid, a shield grid, and a collector.\n   A linear sweep voltage (32 or 22 to 0 V, up or down) was normally applied to the retarding grids in 0.75 s.\n   Interpretation of the resulting current-voltage profiles provided the ion temperature, the ion and electron\n   concentration, some ion composition information, vehicle potential and plasma drift velocity parallel to\n   the velocity vector. Two of the three similar sensors had an additional grid between the entrance and\n   retarding grids in order to protect inner grids from ion bombardment during electron measurements. The\n   other significant feature of these two sensors was that a small positive collector bias could be applied\n   to assure adequate access of thermal electrons to the collector. With the retarding grid at constant zero\n   volts, current changes could be observed for 3-s periods to obtain gradients of ion concentration.\n   Electron parameters were measured in a manner similar to ions. Ions in mass ranges 1 to 4, 14 to 16, 24 to 32\n   and greater than 40 atomic mass units could be identified. The fourth sensor head was for the ion-drift\n   velocity measurements, and consisted of four grounded grids, a negatively biased suppressor grid, and a\n   four-segment collector. Differences in various collector segment currents provided ion-drift directional\n   component information. More details of this experiment are available in\n   W. B. Hanson et al., Radio Sci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 333, 1973. NSSDC has all the useful data that exist\n   from this investigation.",
