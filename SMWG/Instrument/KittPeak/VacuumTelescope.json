        "Description": "After 29 years of solar imaging, the vacuum telescope at \r\nKitt Peak was decommissioned in 2002. Several types of data were derived \r\nfrom daily full-disk observations of the sun: Line of sight magnetic fields;\r\nHeI 1083 nm equivalent width; CaII K line (1 nm passband) intensity; \r\ncontinuum intensity. The SOLIS instrumentation succeeded KPVT.",
