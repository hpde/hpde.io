        "Description": "The spectromagnetograph at Kitt Peak was operational 1992-2002\r\nand produced longitudinal magnetic field strength, pseudo continuum intensity, \r\nDoppler shift, equivalent width, and line depth in Fe I at 868.8 nm over the \r\nperiod November 19, 1992 to 2002 and in Fe I at 550.7 nm over the period \r\nApril 21, 1992 to November 19, 1992. It also produced line strength and intensity \r\nin He I at 1083 nm over the period April 19, 1992 to 2002.  It was superseded by\r\na vector magnetograph in 2003.",
