        "Description": "The objective of this radio science investigation is to search for low-frequency (1.E-4 to 1.E-2 Hz) gravitational waves expected to be generated by the violent collapse of stars, galactic nuclei and other astrophysical objects, and for a gravitational wave background. Doppler data to be analyzed for characteristic signatures are recorded during phases of the ISPM opposition, using the spacecraft telecommunication system and the NASA DSN. Correlative measurements with Galileo are planned.",
