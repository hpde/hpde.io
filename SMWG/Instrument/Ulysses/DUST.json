        "Description": "The objectives of this investigation are to study particulate matter with masses between 5.E-19 and 5.E-10 g in the heliosphere; to determine its physical and dynamical properties as a function of ecliptic latitude and heliocentric distance; and to investigate its interaction with other interplanetary/interstellar phenomena such as solar radiation, solar wind, heliospheric magnetic field, and interstellar neutral gas. The instrument is a multicoincidence plasma impact detector which measures mass, speed, flight direction and electric charge of individual dust particles. The instrument has a mass of 3.75 kg and uses 2.0 W of power. The data rate in 8 bps.",
