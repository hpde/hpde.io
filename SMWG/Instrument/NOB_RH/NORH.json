        "Description": "The Nobeyama Radioheliograph (NoRH) is a radio telescope \r\ndedicated solar observations. It consists of 84 parabolic antennas with \r\n80 cm diameter, sitting on lines of 490 m length in the east/west direction\r\nand of 220 m length in the north/south direction. The first observation was \r\nin April, 1992 and daily 8-hour observations have been done since June, 1992.\r\n\r\nFrequency: 17GHz (Right and left circular polarization), 34GHz (only intensity)\r\nField of view \t        Solar full disk\r\nSpatial resolution \t10 arcsec (17GHz), 5 arcsec (34GHz)\r\nTemporal resolution \t0.1 sec (Event), 1 sec (Steady)\r\n\r\nAs the NoRH is a radio interferometer, original data are sets of \r\ncorrelation values of all the combination of antennas. They correspond \r\nto the spatial Fourier components of the brightness distribution of the \r\nsolar disk. In most cases, it is necessary to synthesize images from the \r\noriginal raw data.\r\n\r\nTo maximize the data use, we prepare images, indices and other related \r\nmaterials routinely and put them on our Web page at \r\nhttp://solar.nro.nao.ac.jp/norh/index.html. This Web page is to help \r\nthe scientists in the world to look for interesting phenomena detected by \r\nthe NoRH and to start the actual analysis using the original data set. \r\nSoftware for image synthesis and analyses are available for remote \r\nuse.",
