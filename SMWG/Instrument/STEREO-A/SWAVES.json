        "Description": "This experiment is designed to measure remotely and in situ:\n* Type II radio bursts associated with electrons accelerated\nby CME-driven shocks;\n* Type III radio bursts associated with\nimpulsively accelerated electrons streaming out from the sun;\n* in situ plasma waves and waveforms.\n\nTwo radio receivers measure wave intensity, source direction and angular size\nin the frequency range 16 MHz to 40 kHz, corresponding to\nheliocentric source distances of about 1 Rs to 1 AU.  One\n10-40 kHz receiver measures radio and plasma waves near the\n1 AU electron plasma frequency. One receiver makes high time\nresolution measurements at 50 MHz.  Time Domain Samplers make\nsimultaneous wideband waveform measurements on three electric\ncomponents.  Antenna systems include three mutually orthogonal\n6-meter monopoles.",
