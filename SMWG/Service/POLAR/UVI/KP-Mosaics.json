        "Description": "\r\nThe Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) is a small camera that detected and produced images of the ultraviolet light of the aurora, day and night.  \r\nUsing any of five specially designed filters the UVI camera imaged an eight degree circular field of view.  Key Parameter (KP) images \r\nare calculated at nominal 5-10 minute intervals at spacecraft altitudes above 6 Re.  The UVI KP image is background subtracted and \r\ncalibrated to radiance values (photon cm^-2 cm^-1). The data is a rectangular two-dimensional array (228 rows x 200 columns). Only a \r\ncircular region of the rectangular array contains valid image data.  The UVI KP Image Archive \r\n(http://tideuvira.nsstc.nasa.gov/uvi/kpgs-Data.htm) allows the user to look at all the KP Mosaics for a selected month.  The gif or png \r\nplot files contain the up to 35 KP images taken with the LBHL (160-190 nm) filter.   Reference images are also provided showing the \r\nlocation of the UVI field of view relative to continental outlines.  UVI Key Parameters are summary data only.  In some cases parameters \r\nsuch as pointing and calibration were not adequate to support quantitative scientific analysis.  They should not to be used for presentation, \r\npublication, or analysis. The UVI KP CDF files only contain output for normal instrument mode when the spacecraft is in 9.2 second science \r\ntelemetry mode.  No Key Parameters are produced when the spacecraft is in maneuver telemetry mode, when UVI is in star (fast) mode, \r\nand when the despun platform is pointed away from the earth.\r\n\t ",
