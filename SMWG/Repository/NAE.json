        "Description": "The NAE repository contains a collection of northern auroral electrojet indices obtained from a virtual observatory representing the collection of magnetometers used in the creation of the NAE datasets. The NAE observatory consists of ground magnetometers from the GIME, THEMIS GBO, INTERMAGNET, DTU, University of Iceland, and NIPR ground magnetometer data. Availability of the NAE index may vary from day to day depending upon magnetometer data availabiliy. SAE indices were only produced when data from all stations were available. Details on many of the magnetometer arrays are available at the AssociationIDs listed below.",
