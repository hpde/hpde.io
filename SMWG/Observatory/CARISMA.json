        "Description": "CARISMA (Canadian Array for Realtime Investigations of Magnetic Activity) is the magnetometer \n\t  element of the Geospace Observatory Canada project.\n\nIt is the continuation and expansion of an original magnetometer array that was part of the CANOPUS \nground based instrumentation array. The data from the array has contributed to the publication of \nhundreds of scientific papers and helped to establish CARISMA as an essential international resource \nfor magnetospheric physics.\n\nThe CARISMA network is an array of magnetometers—devices that are used to measure disturbances in the \nEarth's magnetic field, caused by activity occurring in a region of space near the Earth, known as the \nmagnetosphere.  From these measurements, the nature of the event can be determined, and, by using a \ndistributed array of magnetometers, more information can be calculated about their time and spatial evolution.\n\nThe Northerly CARISMA station, Taloyoak, NUThe CARISMA array spans a range of longitude from Dawson \nCity, YK (near the Alaska border, 220.89°E) to Rankin Inlet, NU (267.89°E) and a range of latitude \nfrom Taloyoak, NU (69.54°N) to Osakis, MN, USA (45.87°N).  Currently most of these sites are on a \nNorth-South meridian known as the 'Churchill Line'.  By arranging the magnetometers in this way, \nit is possible to investigate the radial propagation of events, because the field measured at higher \nlatitudes is affected by regions further from the Earth than those measured at lower latitudes.",
