        "Description": "The Nancay Radioheliograph (NRH; located at 47 N 02 E) \n                provides since the end of 1996 two dimensional images of the radio \n                brightness of the Sun with second time resolution. It consists of \n                two linear antenna arrays, on terrestrial east-west and north-south \n                baselines respectively.  In its earlier versions it operated in 1D \n                only at 169 MHz with both arrays from 1980 until early 1985, and \n                later at 164 MHz with the east-west array, and in a five-frequency \n                mode with the north-south array from 1986 to 1990. Since late summer \n                1991 both arrays of the NRH are operated in the multifrequency mode. \n                Up to five frequencies are chosen in the range 150 - 450 MHz within \n                the restrictions imposed by terrestrial interference.  Since the end \n                of 1996, N/S and E/W arrays can be correlated in the multifrequency \n                mode from 150 to 450 MHz in order to produce 2D radiograms.",
