        "Description": "LOFAR is an interferometer with about 50 000 antennas grouped in 50 stations through \n\t\tEurope, with 60% of them located in the Netherlands. It has been running since 2012. Nan√ßay's \n\t\tLOFAR station is composed of 2 antennas array and one shipment container housing the receptors \n\t\tand the computing systems. It is connected to a central supercomputer in Groningen, Netherlands.\n\t\tThe key scientific objectives are deep sky surveys, the study of reionisation epoch, of variable \n\t\tsources like pulsars, jets, eruptive stars, planets and exoplanets, the detection of very high \n\t\tenergy cosmic rays, and the interplanetary medium physics.\n\t\tLOFAR High Band Array (HBA) covers the spectral range from 120 to 270 MHz",
