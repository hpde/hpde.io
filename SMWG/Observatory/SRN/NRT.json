        "Description": "The Nan√ßay radio-telescope (NRT) is composed of an adjustable plane mirror (200 m x 40 m) \n\t\twhich reflects radio waves towards the spherical mirror (300 m x 35 m). The latter sends those \n\t\twaves towards the focal chariot where they are collected and sent to specific receivers.\n\t\tIt is the world's fourth largest radio-telescope and has been inaugurated on May 15th 1965 by \n\t\tgeneral De Gaulle.\n\t\tInitially built for hydrogen gas observations, this instrument has been constantly improved since \n\t\tthen, today it observes galaxies, star envelops, comets, and it also times pulsars.\n\t\tAntennas : 2, Frequencies : 1.060 to 3.500 GHz",
