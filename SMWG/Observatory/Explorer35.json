        "Description": "NASA's Explorer 35 spacecraft, also known as\n  Anchored IMP B (AIMP B) and as IMP E, was launched into a lunar-\n  centric elliptical orbit in July, 1967.  Apogee was about 5 lunar radii\n  and the period was about 12 hours.  Measurements of thermal\n  plasma, energetic particles, magnetic fields and solar X-rays\n  were made. Explorer 35 was a spin-stabilized spacecraft and\n  the spin axis direction was nearly perpendicular to\n  the ecliptic plane, and the spin rate was 25.6 rpm.\n  The spacecraft was turned off in June, 1973.",
