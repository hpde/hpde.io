        "Description": "The Explorer-class spacecraft, International Sun-Earth Explorer, that were part of the mother/daughter/heliocentric mission (ISEE 1, ISEE 2, ISEE 3). The purposes of the mission were:\n\n            * (1) to investigate solar-terrestrial relationships at the outermost boundaries of the Earth's magnetosphere,\n            * (2) to examine in detail the structure of the solar wind near the Earth and the shock wave that forms the interface between the solar wind and the Earth's magnetosphere,\n            * (3) to investigate motions of and mechanisms operating in the plasma sheets, and\n            * (4) to continue the investigation of cosmic rays and solar flare effects in the interplanetary region near 1 AU.\n\nThe three spacecraft carried a number of complementary instruments for making measurements of plasmas, energetic particles, waves, and fields. The mission thus extended the investigations of previous IMP spacecraft.",
