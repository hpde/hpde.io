        "Description": "DMSP 5D-2/F13, also known as USA 109, is one of a series of meteorological satellites\n   developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP).\n   This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified\n   until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover\n   data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis\n   and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous\n   polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning\n   and the other at local noon. The local time nodes for DMSP F13 are 17:30 and 05:30.\n\n\n            The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for\n   sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the\n   electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment\n   support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction\n   control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled\n   by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the\n   desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to\n   0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic\n   geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element.\n\n\n            The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system and provides real-time or\n   stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor\n   package contains: (1) a microwave imager; (2) a microwave temperature sounder; (3) a microwave\n   water vapor profiler; (4) an ion and electron scintillation monitor; (5) a precipitating electron/ion\n   spectrometer; (6) a gamma/X-ray detector; (7) a magnetometer; and (8) a static earth-viewing sensor\n   monitoring electromagnetic radiation.\n",
