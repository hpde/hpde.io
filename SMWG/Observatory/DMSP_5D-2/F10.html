 		"description": "DMSP 5D-2/F10 is one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by\n   the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously\n   known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective\n   of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental\n   data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements.\n   Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the\n   ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon.\n   The local time nodes for DMSP F10 are 20:30 and 08:30.\n  \n   The 6.4-m-long\n   spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and\n   equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics,\n   reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure\n   containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment;\n   and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination\n   flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking\n   mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a\n   star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of\n   the digital imagery to the nearest picture element.\n  \n   The operational linescan system is the primary\n   data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and\n   infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a\n   microwave temperature sounder, (2) an advanced X-ray detector, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation\n   monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager. Either recorded\n   or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters.\n   Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB,\n   Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time\n   data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world.",
