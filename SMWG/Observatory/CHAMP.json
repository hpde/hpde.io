        "Description": "CHAMP (CHAllenging Microsatellite Payload) is a German\nspacecraft launched July 15, 2000, into an 87 deg inclination, 454 km\naltitude orbit.  It was intended to provide data for improvement of models\nof Earth's gravitational and magnetic fields.  It carried a GPS receiver,\na triaxial accelerometer, vector (fluxgate) and scalar magnetometers, and\na digital ion drift meter for electric field determination.  GPS\noccultation and sounding measurements contributed to atmospheric and\nionospheric profiles.  The mission continues to operate as of January, 2010.\nThe science and data activities of the mission are managed by the\nGeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ; German Research Center for Geosciences) in\nPotsdam.",
