        "Description": "The SuperMAG program involves a collaboration of\nmore than 200 ground geomagnetic observatories coordinated by JHU/APL.\nA heterogenous ensemble of ground station data are made homogeneous\nby conversions to a common time resolution (1 min) and a common coordinate\nsystem (NEZ), by baseline removal, and by data cleanings. Resultant\ndata are intended for studies of varying ionospheric and magnetospheric\ncurrent systems.",
