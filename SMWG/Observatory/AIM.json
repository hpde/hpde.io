        "Description": "AIM (Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere) is a NASA Small\nExplorer spacecraft launched April 25, 2007, into a high-inclination, \n600-km altitude orbit for study of noctilucent clouds (also called Polar \nMesospheric Clouds) that occur at 80-90 km altitudes at high latitudes in \nsummer time and are thought to be formed by ice crystals.\n\nAIM carried three instruments:\n\n* The Cloud Imaging and Particle Size (CIPS) experiment \nthat provides an average 5km x 5km resolution in downward-looking images.\n* The Solar Occultation For Ice Experiment (SOFIE) for limb profiles of \ntemperatures and absorptions for various molecules.\n* The Cosmic Dust Experiment (CDE).",
