        "Description": "IMAGE consists of 41 magnetometer stations maintained by 10 institutes \n\t\t  from Estonia, Finland, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia and Sweden. The prime objectives \n\t\t  of IMAGE are to study auroral electrojets and moving two-dimensional current \n\t\t  systems. The long profile covering geographic latitudes from 51 to 79 degrees \n\t\t  is especially favourable for electrojet studies. Together with other ground-based \n\t\t  recordings (by radars, riometers, all-sky cameras) and satellite observations, \n\t\t  IMAGE is an essential part in the investigations of high-latitude \n\t\t  magnetospheric-ionospheric physics. Together with its predecessor, the EISCAT \n\t\t  magnetometer cross started in 1982, IMAGE also provides high-quality data useful \n\t\t  for studies of geomagnetic induction and long-term geomagnetic activity in the \n\t\t  auroral region.
