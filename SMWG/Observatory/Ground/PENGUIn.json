        "Description": "The digital, low-powered magnetometers in Antarctica are operated by a collaboration between Space @ Virginia Tech, the Space Physics Research Laboratory at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and the National Institute of Aerospace in Hampton, VA. Professor C. Robert Clauer is the PI at Virginia Tech. These magnetometers complete the PENGUIn (Polar Experimental Network for Geospace Upper atmosphere Investigations) 40 degree magnetic meridian chain, conjugate to a chain on the western Greenland coast.",
