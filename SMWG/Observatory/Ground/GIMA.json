Originally \n\t  established as the Alaska Meridian Chain, the number of sites has increased \n\t  to support the GI rocket program carried out at the Poker Flat Rocket Range. \n\t  In addition to fluxgate magnetometer, all-sky cameras, Meridian Scanning \n\t  Photometers and other instruments are occasionally operated at the sites.",
