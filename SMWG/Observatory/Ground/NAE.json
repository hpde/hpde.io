        "Description": "The NAE observatory is a virtual observatory representing the collection of magnetometers used in the \n\t creation of a near conjugate auroral electrojet index dataset. Conjugate to the SAE index. The NAE observatory consists \n\t of ground magnetometers from CARISMA, DTU, GIMA, CANMOS/NRCAN, TGO, and Iceand ground magnetometer stations and arrays. \n\t Availability of the NAE and SAE index may vary from day \n\t to day depending upon magnetometer data availabiliy. NAE indices were only produced when data from all stations were \n\t available. Details on the magnetometer arrays are available in the associationIDs listed below.",
