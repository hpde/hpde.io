        "Description": "DTU Space is monitoring the Earths magnetic field with a network of ground\n    stations in Greenland, Faroe Islands and Denmark. An array with 18 stations at coastal\n    locations and one on the Ice Cap is operated in Greenland. Previously 5 stations were\n    maintained on the Greenland Ice Cap in cooperation with Virginia Tech, USA. All stations p\n    rovide full vector geomagnetic field information with 1 Hz resolution. THL, GDH, NAQ and\n    BFE are geomagnetic observatories and calibrated to INTERMAGNET standards.",
