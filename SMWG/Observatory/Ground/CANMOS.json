        "Description": "The CANMOS (CANadian Magnetic Observatory System) is a modular PC-based data-acquisition\n   system that serves as the automated portion of the Canadian Magnetic Observatories, operated by\n   the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC). CANMOS uses commercially-available magnetometers that\n   provide digital RS232 signals to the central processor PC. Output devices are also connected\n   to the central processor by RS232 links. The concept of modularity applies not only to the hardware,\n   but also to the design of the software running on the central processor.",
