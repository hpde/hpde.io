        "Description": "Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS)\nis a facility at Kitt Peak funded by NSF and designed and built by the National\nSolar Observatory.  It is intended to acquire a multi-decadal (>~25 years) data\nbase for studies of the solar activity cycle, sudden energy releases in the solar\natmosphere, and solar irradiance changes.  It has three primary instruments,\na vector spectromagnetograph (VSM), a full disk patrol (FDP) and an Integrated\nSunlight Spectrometer.  Data are available between August, 2003 and a few days\nago.  Both synoptic and user-driven observations are made.\n",
