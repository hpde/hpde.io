The Climax Molybdenum \n	  Company donated the land for the Observatory, as well as funds for constructing buildings and a $6,000 grant. \n	  Roberts was the sole resident scientist at the isolated mountain Observatory, and he and his wife Janet \n	  remained the only residents in the early years.\n\nDuring World War II, coronagraph observations of solar activity made by Walter Roberts at Climax had important \nimplications for wartime communication over long distances. The relationship between sun weather and radio \ntransmissions was used by the U.S. military in predicting favorable times for scheduling large-scale military \noperations that depended on good radio communications. After the war, the Climax station became the first scientific \ncorporation, the High Altitude Observatory of Harvard University and the University of Colorado.
