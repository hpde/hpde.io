        "Description": "\n     During its operation from 1973 to 1988, the Siple Station\n     experiment provided numerous observations of magnetospheric\n     wave's particle and wave's interactions and it remains the\n     preeminent source for validating computer simulations of whistler\n     mode wave's particle interactions.  The Siple Station Experiment\n     consisted of a transmitting station in Antarctica and a\n     receiving station located at the conjugate point in Quebec,\n     Canada. Siple Station, Antarctica was located at 75.93 deg. S,\n     84.25 deg. W geographic, corresponding to an invariant latitude\n     of 60.4 deg. S, at L = 4.2. The facility operated a  100 kW, 21.2\n     Km elevated dipole transmitting between 1 to ~6kHz. In 1986 the\n     Siple station facility was upgraded with the addition of crossed\n     dipoles for the generation of variable  polarization.\n\n \n   The main observation point for the whistler mode signals\n   from Siple station was near the geomagnetic conjugate point \n   first (1973-1985) at Roberval, Quebec (48.52 deg. N, 72.23 deg. W)\n   and from 1986 to 1988\n   near Lake Mistissini, Canada (50.42 deg. N, 73.87\n   deg. W). The receiver system consisted of two delta-shaped crossed loops\n     mounted on a central 30-foot-high(~9 m) support with a base of 60\n     feet (18.3 m). \n\n    Complete results of the Siple\n   station experiment are summarized in Helliwell, R. A.,(1988)\n   Rev. Geophys., 26, 551-578, but analysis\n   work on this dataset continued well after the experiment\n   ended. These data were originally stored on Ampex magnetic tapes\n   then converted over to a digitized format with some error\n   correction applied as described by Li et al., (2014) JGR, 119,1837-1850.
