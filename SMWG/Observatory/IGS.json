        "Description": "The IGS global system of satellite tracking stations, Data Centers, and Analysis\nCenters puts high-quality GPS data and data products on line in near real time\nto meet the objectives of a wide range of scientific and engineering\napplications and studies.  The IGS collects, archives, and distributes GPS\nobservation data sets of sufficient accuracy to satisfy the objectives of a wide\nrange of applications and experimentation.  These data sets are used by the IGS\nto generate the data products mentioned above which are made available to\ninterested users through the Internet.  In particular, the accuracies of IGS\nproducts are sufficient for the improvement and extension of the International\nTerrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF), the monitoring of solid Earth deformations,\nthe monitoring of Earth rotation and variations in the liquid Earth (sea level,\nice-sheets, etc.), for scientific satellite orbit determinations, ionosphere\nmonitoring, and recovery of precipitable water vapor measurements. \nThe primary mission of the International GPS Service, as stated in the\norganization's 2002-2007 Strategic Plan, is\n    The International GPS Service provides quality data and products as the standard for global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)\nin support of Earth science research, multidisciplinary applications, and\neducation. These activities aim to advance scientific understanding of the Earth\nsystem components and their interactions, as well as to facilitate other\napplications benefiting society.\n    The IGS Terms of Reference (comparable to the by-laws of the organization)\ndescribes in broad terms the goals and organization of the IGS.  To accomplish\nits mission, the IGS has a number of components: an international network of\nover 350 continuously operating dual-frequency GPS stations, more than a dozen\nregional and operational data centers, three global data centers, seven analysis\ncenters and a number of associate or regional analysis centers. The Central\nBureau for the service is located at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, which\nmaintains the Central Bureau Information System (CBIS) and ensures access to IGS\nproducts and information. An international Governing Board oversees all aspects\nof the IGS.  The IGS is an approved service of the International Association of\nGeodesy since 1994 and is recognized as a member of the Federation of\nAstronomical and Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS) since 1996.\n     The IGS collects, archives, and distributes GPS observation data sets of\nsufficient accuracy to meet the objectives of a wide range of scientific and\nengineering applications and studies. These data sets are used to generate the\nfollowing products:\n  * GPS satellite ephemerides\n  * GLONASS satellite ephemerides\n  * Earth rotation parameters\n  * IGS tracking station coordinates and velocities\n  * GPS satellite and IGS tracking station clock information\n  * Zenith tropospheric path delay estimates\n  * Global ionospheric maps\n",
