        "Description": "RHESSI (Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager) is an American (NASA) solar flare observatory that was launched at 20:58 UT on 5 February 2002 by a Pegasus XL rocket which was released from a L-1011 aircraft flying out of the Cape Canaveral AFS. The 293 kg (with fuel), 414 W, 2.2 m (height) x 1.1 m (width) satellite is equipped to image at high resolution solar flares in X-rays and gamma rays. Onboard memory is 4 Gbytes, and telemetry rate is 3.5 Mbits/s. A PDMP exists for archiving the data at the NSSDC.",
