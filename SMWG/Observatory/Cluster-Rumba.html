The original Cluster of four spacecraft experienced\n   a launch failure in 1996. (NSSDC will carry the name \"Cluster96\" in its information files to designate the unsuccessful\n   1996 four-spacecraft Ariane 5 launch.)\n\nPhoenix was approved in July 1996 as a replacement for the lost four-spacecraft group. It was later (April 1997) agreed that\nthe potential science return from a full Cluster reflight was so important that a further three near-replicas of the original\nspacecraft would also be built.\n\nThis Cluster II spacecraft, FM5 (Rumba), was launched together with FM8 (Tango) by a Soyuz-Fregat rocket from Baikonur. The\nfour similar spacecraft of the Cluster II mission are part of ESA's and NASA's Solar-Terrestrial Science Program (STSP). The\npurpose of the Cluster II mission is to study small-scale structures in three dimensions in the Earth's plasma environment,\nsuch as those involved in the interaction between the solar wind and the magnetospheric plasma, in global magnetotail dynamics,\nin cross-tail currents, and in the formation and dynamics of the neutral line and of plasmoids.\n\nThe four Cluster II spacecraft will orbit in a tetrahedral formation in near-polar orbits of nominally 4 x 19.6 Earth radii,\nwith period about 57 hours, and inclination about 90.7 degrees. Relative distances between the spacecraft will be adjusted\nin the course of the mission, depending on the spatial scales of the structures to be studied, varying from a few hundred\nkm to a few Earth radii. The tetrahedral formation is essential for making three-dimensional measurements and for determining\nthe curl of vectorial quantities such as the magnetic field.\n\nThe orbits of all four spacecraft will be frequently maneuvered so as to achieve the targeted investigations.\n\nEach spacecraft will be spin-stabilized, normally at around 15 rpm, and will be cylindrical in shape, with a\n2.9-m diameter and 1.3-m length. It will have two rigid 5-m radial experiment booms, four 50-m experiment wire booms,\nand two axial telecommunications antenna booms. Telemetry downlink bit rate will be 2 to 262 kbit/s.\n\nEach spacecraft will have AC and DC magnetometers, an electric fields and waves sensor, an electron emitter/detector,\nan electron density sounder, electron and ion plasma analysers, an energetic particle detector, an ion emitter, and\na data processing unit.\n\nCluster operations will be performed by ESOC in Darmstadt, Germany, with support from NASA's Deep Space Network.\nCluster is also an IACG mission. The scientific data are distributed by ESOC using CD-ROM as a medium to the\nPrincipal Investigators, Co-Investigators and the network of eight national data centres (6 in Europe, 1 in USA\nand 1 in China) that form the Cluster Science Data System (CSDS).
