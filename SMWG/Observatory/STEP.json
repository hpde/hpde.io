        "Description": "\"STEP Polar Network\" started in 1991 and has become known as the Solar-Terrestrial Energy Program (STEP) that lasted until 1997. However, STEP continues to provide those data for public including:  low time resolution(1 minute) data, high time resolution(1 second) data obtained by fluxgate magnetometgers, and induction magnetometer data which is sampled by 10Hz.",
