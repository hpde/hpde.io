        "Description": "SORCE (SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment) is an American (NASA) Sun-Earth Connection satellite that was launched at 20:13 UT by a Pegasus XL rocket released from a L-1011 cargo aircraft flying out of Cape Canaveral. It is to measure solar irradiance in a number of wavelength-bands through three spectrometers and a photometer.\n\nThe URL\n\nhttp://lasp.colorado.edu/sorce/\n\nprovides much detailed descriptions of the experiments and data availability. The PI is Gary J. Rottman of LASP, University of Colorado, Boulder, with many co-investigators. The Program Manager is Tom Sparn of LASP.",
