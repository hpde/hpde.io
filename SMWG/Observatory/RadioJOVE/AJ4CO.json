        "Description": "AJ4CO Observatory in High Springs, Florida is a\n   participant in the Radio JOVE project providing observations of\n   radio emissions from Jupiter, the Sun, and the Galactic Background\n   to other members of the Radio JOVE community. The observatory\n   consists of a TFD (Terminated Folded Dipole) array and a Radio JOVE\n   dipole array which feed a variety of receiver systems including a\n   Dual-Polarization Spectrograph (DPS), a Tunable Wideband Receiver\n   (TWB), a FS-200B radio spectrograph, and Radio JOVE receivers.\n\n   The TFD array consists of two square arrays on a NS line, eight\n   30-foot TFD elements with beam steering in 5 degree increments NS\n   and 15 degree increments EW.\n\n ",
