        "Description": "ESA's Mars Express mission was launched 02-June-2003\nand arrived at Mars in December, 2003.  A lander, Beagle 2, was deployed\non 19-Dec-2003, but communication was lost prior to any science data\ncapture.  The main spacecraft went into a polar orbit on 25-Dec-2003, with\napogee and perigee altitudes of 11,634 km and 279 km (3.4 and 0.08 Martian\nradii).  The scientific objectives of the 3-axis-stabilized Mars Express\nOrbiter are to obtain global high-resolution photo-geology (10 m resolution),\nmineralogical mapping (100 m resolution) and mapping of the atmospheric\ncomposition, study the subsurface structure, the global atmospheric\ncirculation, and the interaction between the atmosphere and the subsurface,\nand the atmosphere and the interplanetary medium.",
