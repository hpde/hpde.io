        "Description": "The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R Series, GOES-R, is the next Generation of Geostationary Weather Satellites. The GOES-R Series will significantly improve the Detection and Observation of environmental Phenomena that directly affect Public Safety, Protection of Property and our national economic Health and Prosperity. The Satellites will provide Advanced Imaging with increased Spatial Resolution and faster Coverage for more accurate Forecasts, real-time Mapping of Lightning Activity, and improved Monitoring of Solar Activity.\n\nThe GOES-R Series is a four Satellite Program, GOES-R/S/T/U, that will extend the Availability of the operational GOES Satellite System through 2036. The NOAA GOES-R Series of Satellites is designed to improve the Forecasts of Weather, Ocean, and Environment by providing faster and more detailed Data, real-time Images of Lightning, and advanced Monitoring of Solar Activities and Space Weather. GOES 17 can collect three Times more Data at four times Image Resolution, and scan the Planet five times faster than previous Probes.\n\nGOES 17 has the same Instruments and Capabilities as GOES 16, which currently serves as GOES-East, and will complement its work by scanning a different Area of the World. GOES 17 will become GOES-West when it moves to 137° West Longitude and cover the West Coast of the Continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and much of the Pacific Ocean. These two Satellites are expected to monitor most of the Western Hemisphere and detect Natural Phenomena and Hazards almost instantaneously.",
