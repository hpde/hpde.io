        "Description": "GOES 14, also known as GOES-O, is an American (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) geostationary weather satellite that was launched by a Delta 4 rocket from Cape Canaveral at 22:51 UT on 27 June 2009. It is the latest in the series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites which carry an imager, sounder, a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) package, a solar X-ray imager, and SARSAT Search and Rescue ground-data relaying equipment. The SEM consists of an energetic particle sensor, two magnetometers, and solar X-ray and extreme ultraviolet sensors. GOES 14 was placed in orbit originally as a spare.",
