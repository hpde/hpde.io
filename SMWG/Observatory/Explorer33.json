        "Description": "NASA's Explorer 33 spacecraft, also known as\n  Anchored IMP A (AIMP A) and as IMP D, was launched into a geocentric\n  orbit in July, 1966.  Explorer 33 was a spin-stabilized (spin axis\n  parallel to the ecliptic\n  plane, spin period varying between 2.2 and 3.6 s) spacecraft instrumented\n  for studies of interplanetary plasma, energetic charged particles\n  (electrons, protons, and alphas), magnetic fields, and solar X rays\n  at lunar distances. The spacecraft failed to achieve lunar orbit but\n  did achieve mission objectives. Lunar\n  perturbations caused significant variations in orbit parameters\n  The initial apogee occurred at about\n  1600 h local time. Over the first 3-yr period, perigee varied between\n  6 and 44 earth radii. Apogee varied between 70 and 135 earth radii,\n  and the inclination with respect to the equator of the earth varied\n  between 7 and 60 deg. Periods of principal data coverage (essentially\n  100%) are July 1, 1966 (launch), to January 14, 1970; February 21,\n  1970, to March 6, 1970; July 31, 1970, to September 14, 1970; January\n  15, 1971, to February 28, 1971; March 23, 1971, to May 31, 1971; and\n  August 23, 1971, to September 15, 1971. No data were obtained after\n  September 21, 1971.\n",
