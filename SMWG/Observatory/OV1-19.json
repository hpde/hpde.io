        "Description": "OV1-19 was one of four research satellites injected into orbit simultaneously from a single launch vehicle. \n                The spacecraft was an 81-cm-long cylinder measuring 69 cm in diameter, and was fitted with hemispheric multifaced \n                solar panel domes on either end. The spin-stabilized spacecraft had two major objectives: (1) to make a detailed \n                study of events causing and sustaining trapped radiation in the Van Allen belts, and (2) to study the hazards to \n                man of incoming and trapped radiation. The spacecraft performed normally from launch until early 1970, when serious \n                problems developed in its telemetry system. The amount of useful data continually declined during this period, and \n                the spacecraft was deactivated in March 1970.\n            ",
