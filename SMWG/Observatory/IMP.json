        "Description": "The IMP spacecraft series. Prelaunch, the 10 IMP's were\n          called IMP's A-J.  8 of them were intended for geocentric orbits\n          (A-C, F-J) and 2 for selenocentric orbits (D,E). Prelaunch, the\n          latter two were also called Anchored IMPs (AIMPs) A and B. \n          After launch, the 8 intended for geocentric were also called\n          IMPs 1-8 and the 2 intended for lunar orbit were called\n          AIMP 1 and 2.  Only IMP E = AIMP B = AIMP 2 achieved lunar\n          orbit; IMP D = AIMP A = AIMP 1 went into a geocentric orbit.\n          The mapping of prelaunch IMP letters to postlaunch Explorer numbers\n          and IMP numbers was\n\n          +-----------------------------------------------+\n          | IMP (prelaunch) | IMP (postlaunch) | Explorer |\n          |-----------------------------------------------|\n          | A | 1 | 18 |\n          | B | 2 | 21 |\n          | C | 3 | 28 |\n          | D |   | 33 |\n          | E |   | 35 |\n          | F | 4 | 34 |\n          | G | 5 | 41 |\n          | H | 7 | 47 |\n          | I | 6 | 43 |\n          | J | 8 | 50 |\n          +------------+\n          ",
