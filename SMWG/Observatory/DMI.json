        "Description": "\n      An array with 17 stations at coastal locations is operated in Greenland, previously 5 stations were maintained on the Greenland Ice Cap in cooperation with Virginia Tech, USA. All stations provide full vector geomagnetic field information with 1 Hz resolution. THL, GDH, NAQ, BFE and TDC are geomagnetic observatories and calibrated to INTERMAGNET standards.\n",
