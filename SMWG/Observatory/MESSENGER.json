        "Description": "The Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging, MESSENGER, mission, launched on 2004-08-03, was mainly designed to study the characteristics and environment of Mercury from orbit. After an Earth flyby July-August of 2005, Venus flybys October-November of 2006, and May-June of 2007, and Mercury flybys December 2007-January 2008, September-October of 2008, and September-October of 2009, MESSENGER entered Mercury orbit on March 4, 2011. Much data of interest to the heliospheric community was obtained during the cruise phases between planetary encounters from a magnetometer and an energetic particle and plasma spectrometer.",
