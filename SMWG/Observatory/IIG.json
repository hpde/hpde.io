        "Description": "The Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (IIG) today is a leading\n   institute of the country actively engaged in basic and applied research in\n   Geomagnetism and allied areas of Geophysics, Atmospheric, and Space Physics and\n   Plasma Physics. It started out as a successor to the Colaba Magnetic\n   Observatory, set up in 1826, where the first regular magnetic observatory\n   in the country was established in 1841.\n\n      IIG became an autonomous research institute in 1971, and is now under the\n   Department of Science and Technology, Government of India.",
