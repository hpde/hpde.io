        "Description": "The Dynamics Explorer (DE) mission's general objective is to \n          investigate the strong interactive processes coupling the hot, \n          tenuous, convecting plasmas of the magnetosphere and the \n          cooler, denser plasmas and gases corotating in the earth's \n          ionosphere, upper atmosphere, and plasmasphere. Two \n          satellites, DE 1 and DE 2, were launched together and were \n          placed in polar coplanar orbits, permitting simultaneous \n          measurements at high and low altitudes in the same field-line \n          region.",
