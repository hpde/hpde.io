        "Description": "SAC-C is an International (Argentina plus USA, France, Italy, Denmark, and Brazil) satellite that was launched by a Delta 2 rocket at 13:24 UT from Vandenberg AFB. Its mission is to remotely-sense vegetation, wetlands, and ecosystem in four wavelength bands covering 0.4-1.75 microns, with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The orbital planes of SAC-C, EO 1, Landsat 7 (1999-020A), and Terra (1999-068A) are closely coplanar, with a given site being successively visited by each spacecraft within an hour of each other. SAC-C's periapsis is 682 km, its apoapsis is 701 km, it's orbital period is about 99 min, and the inclination of the orbit is 98.2 degrees. Also on-board, that is relevant to the VMO, is a helium magnetometer.",
