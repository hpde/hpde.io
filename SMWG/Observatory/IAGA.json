        "Description": "IAGA, the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (AIGA - Association Internationale de Geomagnetisme et d'Aeronomie) is one of the eight Associations of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). It is a non-governmental body funded through the subscriptions paid to IUGG by its Member Countries. IAGA has a long history and can trace its origins to the Commission for Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity, part of the International Meteorological Organisation which was established in 1873. IAGA coordinates the global network of geomagnetic observatories by providing unique three-letter codes and maintaining an overview over past and present geomagnetic observatories. The list of observatories is maintained by the Working Group for Geomagnetic observations (V-OBS).",
