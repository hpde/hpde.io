        "Description": "The OV3-3 spacecraft was placed into a polar orbit to measure trapped and precipitating particles and \n                correlated electromagnetic wave fields. The spacecraft was spin stabilized at 8 rpm, and its systems performed \n                well for 14 months, until September 1967 when the onboard tape recorder failed. After that time, low-latitude, \n                real-time tracking continued into 1969 when the spacecraft was deactivated.               \n            ",
