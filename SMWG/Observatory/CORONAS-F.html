was launched by a Tsiklon 3 rocket from Plesetsk at 08:00 UT on 31 July 2001. The 2,260 kg (with fuel)<br>
spacecraft will be pointing toward Sun within 10 arc-minutes to conduct a variety of observations.<br>
In broad categories, it carries X-ray monitors to locate sources within 1 arc-sec, radio receivers<br>
to measure flux and polarization, and particle counters.</p>
<p>The DIFOS instrument (Investigator: V. N.<br>
Oraevsky, IZMIRAN) is to monitor fluctuations in light intensity in six optical bands (350, 500, 650,<br>
850, 1,100, and 1.500 nanometer) at a precision of one part in a million. The analysis will reveal a<br>
spectrum of normal mode seismic oscillations in the Sun.</p>
<p>The SORS instrument (Investigators: S. A.<br>
Pulinets, IZMIRAN, and Z. Kloss, CBK-PAN) will monitor solar radio bursts of II, III, and IV types,<br>
in the range 0.1-30 MHz, with 0.5 microvolt sensitivity and through 400 frequency channels, with a<br>
full spectrum enabled in three seconds.</p>
<p>The ZENIT instrument (Investigator: V. N. Oraevsky, IZMIRAN)<br>
is a coronograph to monitor the corona out to six solar radii in the 750-850 nm band, at a resolution<br>
of 1 arc-min. A full scan is done in less than a minute.</p>
<p>The SUFR instrument (Investigator: T. V.<br>
Kazachevskaya, IAG) is a UV radiometer in the 0.1-130 nm band to capture the full disk emission<br>
from the Sun, in the dynamic range 0.1-30 erg/sq-cm/sec.</p>
<p>The VUSS instrument (Investigator: A. A.<br>
Nousinov, IAG) is designed to monitor the intensity of full-disk, 121.6 nm Lyman-Alpha line in a<br>
band of 5 nm width, with a dynamic range of 0.1-30 erg/sq-cm/sec.</p>
<p>The DIAGENESS instrument<br>
(Investigators: Y. Silvester, CBK-PAN, and S. Boldyrev, IZMIRAN) is to scan the Sun's active regions<br>
and flares at five arc-sec resolution in the bands 29.601-33.915, 49.807-53.721, 61.126-67.335 nm at<br>
a tempral resolution of 0.1-10 seconds. It is also to monitor the full disk X-ray emissions in the<br>
bands 2-8 keV, and 10-160 keV at a temporal resolution of about one second.</p>
<p>The RESIK instrument<br>
(Investigator: Y. Silvester, CBK-PAB, and S. Boldyrev, IZMIRAN) is a bent crystal X-ray spectrometer<br>
to monitor the bands 11.23-12.93, 12.74-14.42, 14.36-16.30, 16.53-20.29, 21.54-24.45, 24.80-30.43,<br>
33.69-38.79, 38.21-43.26, and 49.60-60.86 nm. The first seven bands pertain, respectively, to<br>
emissions from Ar, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Fe, K, Ni, and the last is a continuum.</p>
<p>The IRIS experiment<br>
(Investigator: Kocharov, PTI) aims to monitor hard X-ray flares in the 2.0-200 keV energy range<br>
at temporal resolution of 0.01-2.5 seconds, with a sensitivity of 10 nanoergs/sq-cm/sec.<br>
The sensitivity in the 2-15 keV is high enough to capture microflares and precursors in a number<br>
of small width channels.</p>
<p>The HELIKON instrument (Investigator: E. P. Mazets, PTI) is to capture<br>
high energy X-rays and Gamma rays in the range 10 keV-8 MeV. It carries two detectors, one pointing<br>
to the Sun and the other in the anti-solar direction to monitor the energy range in 128 channels,<br>
and with 4,096 channels to cover the lower range of 10 keV-1.0 MeV.</p>
<p>The SKL instrument<br>
(Investigator: S. N. Kuznetsov, NIIYaF-MSU) has three components. The SONG is to measure solar Gamma<br>
rays in the 0.03-100 MeV band through a total of 250 channels, the neutrons in the range 3.0-100 MeV<br>
through five channels, and electrons in the 11-108 MeV range through six channels. The second component,<br>
MKL is to capture protons in the range 1-300 MeV, electrons in the 0.5-12 MeV, protons at &gt;10 MeV,<br>
and electrons at &gt;1.3 MeV. The third component, SKI-3 is to ascertain the chemical composition in<br>
the Z = 1-10 group in the 1.5-20 MeV ions. It has a channel for 1.5-19 MeV protons.</p>
<p>The RES-K instrument (Investogator: I. A. Zhitnik (LPI) is a X-ray spectroheliograph to provide high<br>
resolution images of the solar disk using the emission lines of FeXXIV and FeXXV in the 18.5<br>
-18.7 nm, and the MgXII line in the 84.1-84.3 nm range. Images in the emission lines covering<br>
1800-2050 nm and 2850-3350 nm will also be obtained by scanning the range in widths of 0.3 nm.<br>
The images will be at a spatial resolution of six arc-sec. Each full-disk image is to be produced<br>
in about six seconds.</p>
<p>The RPS instrument (Investigator: V. M. Pankov, IKI, and Yu. D. Kotov, MEPHI)<br>
is an X-ray spectrometer covering the 3-30 keV band in steps of 1.5 keV. The range includes the Fe55<br>
