      <Description>The IMP spacecraft series. Prelaunch, the 10 IMP's were
          called IMP's A-J.  8 of them were intended for geocentric orbits
          (A-C, F-J) and 2 for selenocentric orbits (D,E). Prelaunch, the
          latter two were also called Anchored IMPs (AIMPs) A and B. 
          After launch, the 8 intended for geocentric were also called
          IMPs 1-8 and the 2 intended for lunar orbit were called
          AIMP 1 and 2.  Only IMP E = AIMP B = AIMP 2 achieved lunar
          orbit; IMP D = AIMP A = AIMP 1 went into a geocentric orbit.
          The mapping of prelaunch IMP letters to postlaunch Explorer numbers
          and IMP numbers was
