        "Description": "The Juno Waves calibrated full resolution survey data set \n        includes all low rate science electric spectral densities from 50Hz to \n        41MHz and magnetic spectral densities from 50Hz to 20kHz with complete sweeps at 30,\n        10 and 1 second intervals depending on the instrument mode. \n        This is a complete full resolution data set containing all low rate science\n        data received from Waves from launch until the end of mission including \n        initial checkout, the Earth flyby, the Jupiter orbits and all cruise data. Data are \n        acquired from the Waves Low Frequency Receiver (LFR) and High Frequency Receiver (HFR)\n        and are processed into spectra on board.\n      ",
