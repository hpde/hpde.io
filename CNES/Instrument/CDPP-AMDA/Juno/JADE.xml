      <Description>The Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment (JADE) on Juno provides the 
        critical in situ measurements of electrons and ions needed to understand the plasma 
        energy particles and processes that fill the Jovian magnetosphere and ultimately produce 
        its strong aurora. JADE is an instrument suite that includes three essentially identical 
        electron sensors (JADE-Es), a single ion sensor (JADE-I), and a highly capable 
        Electronics Box (EBox) that resides in the Juno Radiation Vault and provides all 
        necessary control, low and high voltages, and computing support for the four sensors. 
        The three JADE-Es are arrayed 120∘ apart around the Juno spacecraft to measure complete 
        electron distributions from ˜0.1 to 100 keV and provide detailed electron pitch-angle 
        distributions at a 1 s cadence, independent of spacecraft spin phase. JADE-I measures 
        ions from ˜5 eV to ˜50 keV over an instantaneous field of view of 270∘×90∘ in 4 s and 
        makes observations over all directions in space each 30 s rotation of the Juno spacecraft. JADE-I also provides ion composition measurements from 1 to 
        50 amu with m/Δ m˜2.5, which is sufficient to separate the heavy and light ions, as well as
        O+ vs S+, in the Jovian magnetosphere.</Description>
