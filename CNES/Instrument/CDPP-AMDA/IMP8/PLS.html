To convert thermal speed to temperature in eV, multiply 0.0052 by the square of the thermal speed; to convert to temperature [K], multiply the square of the thermal speed by 60.5 . This is probably the most inaccurate moment parameter, since moments tend to underestimate the temperature in cold distributions.\n      * The angles are in degrees. Azimuth is E/W, meaning bulk flow from the East or the West side of the Sun respectively, while flow elevation is from North or South of the s/c spin plane (almost identical to the plane of the ecliptic).

The aberration in velocity due to Earth's motion around the Sun has been removed from the best values, but not from the moment values \"Threshsp\" values are determined from currents greater than a threshold value, below which we are not confident about the contribution of noise. Dr. Joseph King (GSFC) has looked at 27-day averages of OMNIWeb data from 1984-1994. He finds (and we agree) that there is an offset of about +2 degrees (from the South) in the N/S angle and an annual variation of that angle with an amplitude of about 1 degree. We believe that the annual variation is due to a tilt of the s/c spin axis. He found the mean flow longitude in that study to be -0.3 degrees with no obvious annual variation.\n      * The moment values, for angles and for the speed, do NOT have aberration corrections included. This means that the total speeds are slightly too low, and that the angles are not really correct. In particular, the azimuthal (E/W) angle is about 4 degrees too positive; this can clearly be seen where both nonlinear and moment angles are available.\n      * For papers and presentations using these data, please acknowledge that you received them from the MIT Space Plasma Physics Group.
