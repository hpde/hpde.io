      <Description>The magnetometer on Pioneer 11 was a triaxial helium magnetometer with seven dynamic ranges, from plus or minus 2.5 nT to plus or minus 1.0E-3 T. The linearity was 0.1% and the noise threshold was 0.01 nT rms for 0-1 Hz. The accuracy was 0.5% of full scale range. The experimenter used RTN coordinates in the data analysis. In this system, R (or X) is radially outward from the sun, T (or Y) was parallel to the sun's equatorial plane and had its direction given by the cross product of the sun's spin vector into the radial direction (i.e., into R), and N (or Z) completed the right-handed orthogonal system (positive northward). A detailed instrument description may be found in Smith et al., IEEE Trans. On Magnetics, v. M-11, p. 962, July 1975. Data include the interplanetary region.</Description>
