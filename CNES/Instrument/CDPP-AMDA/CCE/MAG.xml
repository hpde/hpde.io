      <Description>The Magnetic Field Experiment (MFE) includes a fluxgate magnetometer sensor mounted on a 2.3 m boom. 
        The fluxgate sensor was sampled at a rate of 8 vector samples/s. It had seven automatically switchable ranges (from +/- 16 nT to +/- 65,536 nT) with resolution 
        commensurate with a 13-bit A/D converter, and was read out at 8.6 vector samples/s. The signals from two sensors 
        (one parallel to the spin axis and one orthogonal) were also fed into 5-50 Hz bandpass channels that were read out every 5 s. 
        The data span the entire AMPTE-CCE mission, from 1984 day 234, August 21, through 1989 day 009 with occasional data gaps. 
        A lengthy data gap occurred in 1986 from day 252, September 9 through day 286, October 12, during an extended eclipse period.
