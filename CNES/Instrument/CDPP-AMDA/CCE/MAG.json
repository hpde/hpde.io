        "Description": "The Magnetic Field Experiment (MFE) includes a fluxgate magnetometer sensor mounted on a 2.3 m boom. \n        The fluxgate sensor was sampled at a rate of 8 vector samples/s. It had seven automatically switchable ranges (from +/- 16 nT to +/- 65,536 nT) with resolution \n        commensurate with a 13-bit A/D converter, and was read out at 8.6 vector samples/s. The signals from two sensors \n        (one parallel to the spin axis and one orthogonal) were also fed into 5-50 Hz bandpass channels that were read out every 5 s. \n        The data span the entire AMPTE-CCE mission, from 1984 day 234, August 21, through 1989 day 009 with occasional data gaps. \n        A lengthy data gap occurred in 1986 from day 252, September 9 through day 286, October 12, during an extended eclipse period.\n      ",
