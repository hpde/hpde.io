        "Description": "STAFF is one of the five complementary experiments which form the Wave Experiment Consortium on Cluster. STAFF consists of:\n        * a triaxial boom-mounted search-coil magnetometer to measure the magnetic components of electromagnetic fluctuations (up to 4 KHz); and, \n        * a spectrum analyzer to compute the 25 auto- and cross-correlation coefficients of the spectral matrix, using three magnetic and two electric components of the waves. \n        \n        The magnetic waveform (up to either 10 Hz or 180 Hz) is also transmitted. The Z-axis sensor is parallel to the spacecraft spin axis.\n        Each sensor consists of a high-permeability core embedded inside two solenoids. The frequency response of the main winding is flattened by a secondary winding through a flux feedback effect, in the range 40--4000 Hz.",
