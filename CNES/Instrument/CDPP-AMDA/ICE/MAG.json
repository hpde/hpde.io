        "Description": "The vector helium magnetometer is mounted on the end of a 3 m boom and makes in-situ measurements of \n      the ambient magnetic field vector in the frequency range 0-3 Hz.  The instrument automatically chooses \n      one of eight ranges in which to operate, the four lowest full-scale ranges being +/-4, +/- 14, +/-42, \n      and +/- 146 nT.  The precision of measurement is 1/256 of the full-scale field values (0.016, 0.055nT, etc.).  The absolute accuracy is limited by \n      knowledge of the spacecraft magnetic field, which is presently known to better than 0.1 nT.  The time \n      resolution corresponds to three triaxial samples per second at 1024 bit/s .  The magnetometer contains a three- channel spectrum analyzer which \n      is connected to the search-coil sensor of the plasma- wave investigation.",
