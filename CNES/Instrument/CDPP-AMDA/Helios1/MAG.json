        "Description": "E2 : The Förster probe experiment E2 is a three component-vector magnetometer. Its purpose is to \ncontinuously observe the interplanetary magnetic field in a frequency range up to 4 Hz. Thereby certain \nphenomena are to be analysed as a function of the distance from the sun e.g. the spiral structure and \ndiscontinuities. The measurement ranges are ± 100 nT and ± 400 nT. The resolution is ± 0.2 nT and ±\n0.8 nT respectively.\n\nFor accurate measurements of the zero offset of each sensor the component parallel to the spinaxis can \nbe flipped by 90°. Depending on telemetry format and bitrate the digital data are fed into a time average \ncomputer or directly connected to telemetry. A shock identification-computer triggers the S/C core \nmemory in case of discontinuities with variations of the ambient magnetic field magnitude.\n\nThe Förster probe experiment E2 is a three-axe vector magnetometer. It is used for the continuous \nobservation of the interplanetary magnetic field in a frequency range from 0 to 4 Hz. This will be \ninvestigated phenomena such as the spiral structure and discontinuities as a function of the distance \nfrom the Sun. The measuring ranges are ± 100 nT and ± 400 nT with a resolution of ± 0.2 nT or ± 0.8 nT. \nThe component that is parallel to the axis of the spin, to perform precise zero point provisions of each \nsensor is rotated 90 degrees. Depending on format and bit rate digital data pass through an average \ncomputer or directly to the telemetry. A shock wave identification computer triggers the S/C core memory \nin the presence of discontinuities with magnetic field variations.\n\nE3 :  The Rome‐GSFC magnetic field experiment utilized a triaxial fluxgate (saturable inductor) \nmagnetometer. \n        ",
