        "Description": "The SPAN-Ai instrument uses curved plates to create electrostatic optics that sort incoming ions based on their energy-per-charge and utilizes segmented anodes and electrostatic deflectors to select particles based on their azimuthal and elevation angles. \n        This allows each particle's velocity to be determined. SPAN-Ai alos has time-of-flight electrons that can measure the mass-to-charge ratio of the incoming ions. \n         * Sensor Type: Electrostatic Analyzer with Time-of-Flight\n         * Particles Measured: Positively charged ions\n         * Energy Range: TBD-30,000 V (proton speeds of TBD-2400 km/s)\n         * Spacecraft Placement: Ram-pointing\n         * Heritage Instruments: MAVEN/SWIA, THEMIS/ESA, and Wind/3DP\n         * Fun Fact: By using the time-of-flight electrons in addition to the energy/charge selection SPAN-Ai can unambiguously measure the proportion of helium nuclei compared to that of protons. \n      ",
