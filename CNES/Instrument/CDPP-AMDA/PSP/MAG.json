        "Description": "The Fields Experiment will make direct measurements of electric and magnetic fields, \n        radio emissions, and shock waves that course through the Sun's atmospheric plasma.\n        The experiment also serves as a giant dust detector, registering voltage signatures when specks of space dust hit the spacecraft's antenna.\n        The FIELDS suite consists of four electric field antennas (V1-V4) mounted near the edge of the SPP heat shield, a voltage sensor (V5), mounted on the SPP magnetometer boom with two fluxgate magnetometers (MAGs) and a search coil magnetometer (SCM).\n      ",
