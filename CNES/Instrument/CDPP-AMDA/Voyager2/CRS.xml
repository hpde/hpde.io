      <Description>This investigation studied the origin and acceleration process, life history, and dynamic contribution of interstellar cosmic rays, the nucleosynthesis of elements in cosmic-ray sources, the behavior of cosmic rays in the interplanetary medium, and the trapped planetary energetic particle environment. The instrumentation included a High-Energy Telescope System (HETS) and a Low-Energy Telescope System (LETS). The HETS covered an energy range between 6 and 500 MeV/nucleon for nuclei ranging in atomic numbers from 1 through 30. In addition, electrons in the energy range between 3 and 100 MeV were measured by this telescope and an electron telescope. The LETS measured the energy and determined the identity of nuclei for energies between .15 and 30 MeV/nucleon and atomic numbers from 1 to 30. The instruments also measured the anisotropies of electrons and nuclei. In addition, electrons in the energy range between 3 and 100 MeV were measured by the electron telescope.</Description>
