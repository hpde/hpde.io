      <Description>MAG includes both a fluxgate magnetometer and a 
        vector/scalar helium magnetometer. 
        Because magnetometers are sensitive to electric currents and 
        ferrous metal components, they are generally placed on an extended boom, 
        as far from the spacecraft as possible. On Cassini, the flux gate magnetometer is 
        located midway out on the 11-meter (36-foot) magnetometer boom extending out 
        from the spacecraft, and the vector/scalar helium magnetometer is located at the 
        end of the boom. The boom itself, composed of thin, nonmetallic rods, was folded 
        during launch and deployed about two years after launch. 
        The magnetometer electronics are located in a bay in the Cassini 
        orbiter's spacecraft body.</Description>
