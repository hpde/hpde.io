        "Description": "CAPS consists of three sensors, all mounted on a common scanning platform:\n* the Electron Spectrometer (ELS), which measures the flux of electrons as a function of energy/charge and aperture entry direction. Its energy range is 0.7 eV to 30 keV.\n* the Ion Beam Spectrometer (IBS), which measures the flux of positively charged ions of all species as a function of energy/charge and aperture entry direction.Its energy range is 1 eV to 50 keV.\n* the Ion Mass Spectrometer (IMS), which provides species-resolved measurements of the flux of positively charged atomic and molecular ions as a function of energy/charge vs. aperture entrydirection. Its energy range is 1 eV to 50 keV. ",
