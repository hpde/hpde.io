        "Description": "\n        The instrument consisted of an electric dipole antenna with 7-m separation between its sensors and a high permeability core coil  \n        to measure the magnetic component of the wave field. The electric component was measured up to 2 MHz and  \n        the magnetic component up to kHz. The signal processing equipment was composed of a stepped-frequency  \n        analyzer covering the range up to 130 kHz and four discrete filters with 10% bandwidths covering the  \n        range up to 2 MHz. A correlator (64 point auto) permitted study at higher frequency resolution.\n        ",
