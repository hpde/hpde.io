        "Description": "The instrument was a three-axis fluxgate magnetometer mounted on a 2 m boom. \n        It had two switchable ranges (±4 µT, and ±60 µT) with resolutions of 0.12 and 1.8 nT, \n        respectively and was read out at 32, 16, 8, or 4 vector samples per second, \n        depending on the T/M rate. Signals from each sensor were also fed into four band pass \n        filters with 5.5, 11, 22, and 44 Hz center frequencies and were read out up to two times per second. \n        The IRM's spin is constant over the period of the measurements at 4.053 s\n      ",
