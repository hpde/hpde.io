        "Description": "\n        The PEACE instrument consists of two sensors, HEEA (High Energy Electron Analyser) and LEEA (Low Energy Electron \n        Analyser),  and  a  data  processing  unit,  the  DPU.  The  sensors  are  Top  Hat  electrostatic  analysers.  The  basic  measurement \n        made by PEACE is the  number of counted electrons per accumulation time. The satellite spin period, Tspin\n        , is measured as  the time taken between two detections of the\n        Sun by the  spacecraft sun sensor (which is expected to be 4 seconds ±10%). \n        Within  the  PEACE  DPU,  the  spin  period  is subdivided  into  1024  equal  parts,  of  duration  Tacc\n        ,  the PEACE accumulation time. The instrument measurement cycle \n        is thus adjusted to match the spin period so that PEACE collects data from a  full \n        4pi solid angle (i.e. provides all-sky coverage) during each and every spin. For a nominal 4 second spin, Tacc\n        ~ 3.9 msec.\n        In reality this is calculated from the duration of the previous spin\n        provided by the spacecraft housekeeping.\n      ",
