        "Description": "The LAT is an imaging high-energy gamma-ray telescope covering the energy range from about 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. \n        Such gamma rays are emitted only in the most extreme conditions, by particles moving very nearly at the speed of light. \n        The LAT's field of view covers about 20% of the sky at any time, and it scans continuously, covering the whole sky every three hours",
