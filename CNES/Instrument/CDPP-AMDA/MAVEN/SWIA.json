        "Description": "The Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) is a part of the Particles and Fields (P and F) Package and measures the solar wind and magnetosheath proton flow around Mars and constrains the nature of solar wind interactions with the upper atmosphere.\n         Goals:\n        *Determine the ionization rates of neutrals from charge exchange, as an input to atmospheric loss processes\n        *Determine the pickup acceleration of newly formed ions by the v x B electric field\n        *Measure the flow of solar wind energy through the Martian magnetosphere\n        *Measure the structure and variability of the Martian magnetosphere\n        *Measure basic space plasma phenomena, including reconnection, flux ropes, plasmoids, bulk plasma escape, auroral processes, and boundary instabilities, throughout the Martian system\n      ",
