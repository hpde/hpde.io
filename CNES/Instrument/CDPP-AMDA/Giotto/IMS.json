        "Description": "The ion mass spectrometer consists of two major subsystems. One section, the High Energy Range Spectrometer (HERS) was designed to measure the ion abundances and the 3-dimensional velocity distribution outside the contact surface, where the ions are hot and there is considerable turbulence. The other section, the High Intensity Spectrometer (HIS) was designed to measure the abundances of the low-energy ions inside the contact surface, where the ions were expected to have higher abundances and lower temperatures. This section contained separate Mass and Angle Analyzers. Both sections of the instrument were powered and controlled from a common power supply and control unit. A ",
