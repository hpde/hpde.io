        "Description": "* The Absolute Scalar Magnetometer (ASM) measures the magnetic field intensity at the tip of the boom. The ASM is an absolute instrument, i.e. it is not subject to changes of its intrinsic parameters over time. It uses the PPS as the absolute, external reference. \n      * The Vector Field Magnetometer (VFM) measures the magnetic field vector at the tip of the optical bench on the boom. The sensor is a 3-axis Compact Spherical Coil (CSC) with a 3-axis Compact Detector Coil (CDC) inside. The instrument operates as a closed-loop system adjusting the compensating CSC currents to maintain a null field at the detector coils within the sphere. The VFM is an analogue instrument and as such subject to temporal changes due to radiation and aging effects of the electronics. The effects are only significant in the bias and linear scale parameters of the characterization; hence these parameters are estimated daily through a comparison of the VFM output with the ASM scalar magnetometer output.",
