        "Description": "\n        The objective of the Comprehensive Plasma Instrumentation (CPI) investigation is to make comprehensive observations  \n        of the three-dimensional velocity distribution functions of electrons and positive ions, with identification of ion species.  \n        The instrument contains three sets of quadrispherical analyzers with channel electron multipliers.  \n        These three obtain three-dimensional measurements for hot plasma and solar wind electrons, for solar wind ions,  \n        and for positive-ion composition measurements. The positive-ion composition measurement of the Ion Composition  \n        (IC) analyzer includes five miniature imaging mass spectrometers at the exit aperture of the analyzer, and covers  \n        masses from 1 to 550 u/Q at 100 eV, and 1 to 55 u/Q at 10 keV. The Hot Plasma (HP) analyzer measures electrons and ions  \n        in the range 1-50,000 eV/Q. The Solar Wind (SW) analyzer measures ions from 150 to 7,000 eV/Q.  \n        Sequencing of the energy analyzers and mass spectrometers, and other control functions, are provided by two microprocessors. \n      ",
