      <Description> The ESA Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko carried a small but 
        comprehensive set of plasma instruments known as the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC), 
        monitoring the cometary plasma from arrival in August 2014 to end of mission in September 
        2016. Among the RPC instruments was the Langmuir probe instrument LAP, with chief 
        mission to measure:   
        * Plasma density, ne
        * Spacecraft potential, Vsc
        * Electron temperature, Te
        * Electric field, E
        * Ion flow speed, ui
        * Photoemission current, Iph
        * Wave activity
        
        The LAP sensors are two spherical probes, 5 cm in diameter, known as LAP1 and LAP2, one 
on each of the two booms protruding a few meters from the s/c body. The primary 
parameters actually measured by the instrument is the current flowing to (or the voltage of) 
the probes when some bias voltage (or bias current) is applied to it, which are the data 
transmitted to ground. From these data the parameters above have been derived, for some 
products also with use of data from RPC-MIP. Do not expect all parameters to be available at 
any given time.
