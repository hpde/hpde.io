        "Description": "The ﬂuxgate magnetometer experiment onboard the ROSETTA spacecraft aims to measure\nthe magnetic ﬁeld in the interaction region of the solar wind plasma with comet 67P/Churyumov-\nGerasimenko. It consists of a system of two ultra light (about 28 g each ) triaxial ﬂuxgate magnetometer\nsensors, mounted on the 1.5 m long spacecraft boom. The measurement range of each sensor is\n±16384 nT with quantization steps of 31 pT. The magnetometer sensors are operated with a time\nresolution of up to 0.05 s, corresponding to a bandwidth of 0–10 Hz. This performance of the RPC-\nMAG sensors allows detailed analyses of magnetic ﬁeld variations in the cometary environment. RPC-\nMAG furthermore is designed to study possible remnant magnetic ﬁelds of the nucleus, measurements\nwhich will be done in close cooperation with the ROSETTA lander magnetometer experiment ROMAP.\n",
