        "Description": "ROSINA, the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis, \n        is a combination of two mass spectrometers and a pressure sensor. \n        \n        The mass spectrometers will determine the composition of the comet's atmosphere and \n        ionosphere, measure the temperature and bulk velocity of the gas and ions, and \n        investigate reactions in which they take part. \n        \n        The ROSINA pressure sensor is capable of \n        measuring both total and ram pressure, and will be used to determine the gas density and \n        rate of radial gas flow.",
