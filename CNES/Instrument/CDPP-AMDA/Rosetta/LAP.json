        "Description": " The ESA Rosetta mission to comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko carried a small but \n        comprehensive set of plasma instruments known as the Rosetta Plasma Consortium (RPC), \n        monitoring the cometary plasma from arrival in August 2014 to end of mission in September \n        2016. Among the RPC instruments was the Langmuir probe instrument LAP, with chief \n        mission to measure:   \n        * Plasma density, ne\n        * Spacecraft potential, Vsc\n        * Electron temperature, Te\n        * Electric field, E\n        * Ion flow speed, ui\n        * Photoemission current, Iph\n        * Wave activity\n        \n        The LAP sensors are two spherical probes, 5 cm in diameter, known as LAP1 and LAP2, one \non each of the two booms protruding a few meters from the s/c body. The primary \nparameters actually measured by the instrument is the current flowing to (or the voltage of) \nthe probes when some bias voltage (or bias current) is applied to it, which are the data \ntransmitted to ground. From these data the parameters above have been derived, for some \nproducts also with use of data from RPC-MIP. Do not expect all parameters to be available at \nany given time.\n      ",
