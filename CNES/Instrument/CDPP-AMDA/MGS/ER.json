        "Description": "The Electron Reflectometer Data Record (ERDR) is a time ordered series of electron measurements from the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mission. \n        Each record consists of a time tag with 19 scalar data points representing measurements of the electron flux in 19 different energy channels, \n        ranging from 10 eV to 20 keV, with an energy resolution of 25%. Each data point is a measure of the electron flux (cm-2 sec-1 ster-1 eV-1) averaged \n        over a 360 x 14 degree disk-shaped field of view (FOV). During the Mapping Phase, as the spacecraft orbits the planet the ER field of view sweeps out\n        the entire sky (4-pi ster) every 58.5 minutes, which is much longer than the integration time per record (2 to 48 sec, depending on energy and telemetry rate)\n        and much longer than most timescales of interest in Mars' plasma environment",
