      <Description>The Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) is an instrument suite comprising different sensors that have been designed 
        to measure the spectra, composition, time variations, and directional distributions ofenergetic particles. 
        These measurements will be performed over a partly overlapping energy range encompassing a few keV to 
        450 MeV/n, with sufficient time, energy, angular, and mass resolution to achieve the mission science goals. 
        The EPD consists of the following units :
        * Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph (SIS). 
        
        SIS provides observations of multiple species 
        between H-Fe between energies just above the solar wind to multiple MeV/nucleon. 
        SIS consists of 2 telescopes (SIS-A and SIS-B) pointing in different directions and sharing the same electronics box. 
        SIS is able to identify ion species by measuring the time of flight of the particles that enter in the detector, 
        as well as its energy, thus providing an indirect measure of their mass.
