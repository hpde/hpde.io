        "Description": "The Proton-Alpha Sensor (PAS) is designed to continuously determine the 3D \ndistribution functions of the dominant ions of the solar wind, from 200 eV to 20 KeV, \nwithout mass and charge selection. In practice, this concerns mostly the proton and alfa \npopulations. These measurements are used to calculate the density, speed, pressure \nand temperature tensors of the main component of the solar wind.\n\nAt full resolution, PAS measures the 3D ion distribution function, in the form of arrays of \n96 energies, 11  azimuth angles and 9 elevation angles, in about ~1 second. The \nenergy and the angle of elevation are selected by imposing different high voltages to \nthe electrodes of the deflection system and the electrostatic analyzer. The 11 azimuthal \nangles correspond to the 11 detectors of the instrument (channeltron’).\n\nIn ‘burst‘ mode, the measurement rate can reach up to 20 Hz. The phase space \nsampling is then reduced, for example by 24 energies and 5 deflections, which allows \nto increase the time cadence of distribution functions measurements. An algorithm \n(peak tracking procedure) is used to select the peak of the distribution and to center \nsampling around this peak.\n\nThe different types of sampling are programmed in the form of cyclograms. They define \nthe operation of the instrument over periods of several days. In normal mode, the \nfunctions are measured every 4 s with, every 300 s, a short burst mode of 9 s \n(SnapShot). ‘Long’ burst mode is also acquired every day, consisting in 300 s of \ncontinuous sampling at high cadence. The sampling frequency during burst or \nsnapshots is generally of 4 distributions / s (4 Hz analysis).",
