        "Description": "The Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) is an instrument suite comprising different sensors that have been designed \n        to measure the spectra, composition, time variations, and directional distributions ofenergetic particles. \n        These measurements will be performed over a partly overlapping energy range encompassing a few keV to \n        450 MeV/n, with sufficient time, energy, angular, and mass resolution to achieve the mission science goals. \n        The EPD consists of the following units :\n      * Electron Proton Telescope (EPT). \n      \n      EPT measures electrons and ions (mostly protons) in the \n      lower energy part of the energetic particle spectrum (25 - 500 keV for electrons and from 25 keV to few MeV for ions). \n      It relies on the magnet/foil technique adapted from STEREO/SEPT to separate electrons and ions. \n      EPT consists of 2 double-ended telescopes providing 4 fields of view. Each telescope end has 2 channels, \n      one of them is equipped with a set of magnets deflecting electrons and measures only ions, \n      the other channel contains a foil that stops ions with energies below 400 keV while leaving the electron \n      spectrum unchanged in the measured range.",
