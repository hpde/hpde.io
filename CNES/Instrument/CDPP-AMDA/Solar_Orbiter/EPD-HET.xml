      <Description>The Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) is an instrument suite comprising different sensors that have been designed 
        to measure the spectra, composition, time variations, and directional distributions ofenergetic particles. 
        These measurements will be performed over a partly overlapping energy range encompassing a few keV to 
        450 MeV/n, with sufficient time, energy, angular, and mass resolution to achieve the mission science goals. 
        The EPD consists of the following units :
      *  High Energy Telescope (HET). 
      
        HET measures electrons, protons and heavy ions and covers 
        the upper energy end of the EPD range. There two HET units, each consisting of a double-sided telescope and an 
        electronics box which is shared with EPT. Consequently it provides measurements in 4 distinct fields 
        of view (the same as EPT). Each telescope contains 2 solid state detectors (A and B) for each direction and a shared BGO 
        scintillator (C). Measuring the characteristics of the energy deposition in the different detectors, HET is able to 
        identify particle species in a wide energy range.</Description>
