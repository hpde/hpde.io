        "Description": "The TBF experiment onboard the AUREOL3 satellite was designed to measure two electric and three magnetic wave field components in the range from 10 Hz to 16 kHz. The electric field is measured using spherical probes located at the tip of booms and the alternative magnetic field is measured using a search-coil instrument. The Waveform data are related to the high bit-rate real-time telemetry (TMF) and the Filter-Banks data to the tape-recorded telemetry (TMS). The TBF experiment is well suited for the study of electrostatic and electromagnetic waves and related phenomena in the upper ionosphere from 400 to 2000 km.\n\nThe archived data are :\n\n    Amplitude waveforms of two electric and three magnetic components sampled at 5000 Hz.\n    Output amplitudes from three banks of filters (filter-banks data set).",
