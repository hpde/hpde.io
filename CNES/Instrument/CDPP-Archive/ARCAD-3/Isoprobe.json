        "Description": "The ISOPROBE (Interferometer Self-Oscillating PROBE) experiment on board the AUREOL3 satellite (ARCAD3 project) uses the mutual impedance probing technique to make thermal plasma (electron) measurements. The basic principle is to make use of measurements of the mutual impedance between the transmission and reception dipoles that are immersed into the surrounding plasma. Since the dielectric properties of this plasma determine the frequency response, the main plasma parameters can be deduced.",
