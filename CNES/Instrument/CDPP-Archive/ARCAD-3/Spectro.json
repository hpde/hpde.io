        "Description": "The SPECTRO experiment onboard the AUREOL-3 satellite has been designed to measure auroral particle energy spectra, angular distributions in the energy range 10 eV- 21 keV/q and ion mass spectra from 1 to 32 AMU up to 14 keV/q. A number of various studies have been carried out, e.g., acceleration of auroral electrons, heating and acceleration of ionospheric ions, structure of large and small scale field aligned currents in the cusp, structure of the cusp region for various interplanetary conditions, auroral signature of acceleration mechanisms acting in the near Earth and distant tail.\n\nArchived SPECTRO data were provided by a set of independent and complementary instruments:\n(a) the low-energy plasma instrument ROBE,\n(b) the very low energy sensor TBE,\n(c) the 2 ion energy-mass spectrometers ION1 and ION2.\nData from other complementary russian particle instruments are available through the IKI WEB site (http://www.iki.rssi.ru/eng/).\n",
