        "Description": "Ground based measurements: Ultra low frequency magnetic field components (0.05 - 11.5 Hz), auroral fluctuations and DC magnetic field in coordination with GEOS-1 and GEOS-2.\nThe three orthogonal magnetic sensors are search coil magnetometers. The Z component is vertical outward, the X component is towards North and Y is towards West. This system is called NWV. Correspondence with VDH system is: V=Z, D=-Y, H=X. Typical sensitivities are 0.1 gamma/Hz at 0.1 Hz and 0.0002 gamma/Hz at 10 Hz. The dynamic range of the telemetry is 72 dB.",
