        "Description": "The High Frequency Receiver (HFR) is a dual channel radio receiver covering the 3.5 kHz to 16.125 MHz frequency band. It is composed of 2 sub-receivers. The low frequency subsystem is divided into 3 frequency bands (3.5-16 kHz, 16-71 kHz and 71-190kHz), each of these sampled in 8, 16 or 32 log-spaced sub-bands. The high frequency subsytem is divided into 2 frequency bands (100-4125 kHz and 125-16125 kHz), in which the frequencies are linearly swept with 25 and 50 kHz steps respectively. Within these steps, 1, 2 4 or 8 linearly spaced sub-bands can be selected. The integration time is also tunable.\n\nThis radio receiver provides goniopolarimetric (or Direction-Finding) measurement, with which we can reconstruct the direction of arrival, the polarization and the flux of observed radio waves. This receiver has been developped and built at LESIA (Laboratoire d'Etudes Spatiales et Instrumentation en Astrophysique).",
