        "Description": "The STEREO WAVES experiment is designed to measure remotely and in situ:\n* Type II radio bursts associated with electrons accelerated by CME-driven shocks,\n* Type III radio bursts associated with impulsively accelerated electrons streaming out from the sun,\n*  In situ plasma waves and waveforms.\nTwo radio receivers measure wave intensity, source direction and angular size in the frequency range 16 MHz to 40 kHz, corresponding to heliocentric source distances of about 1 Rs to 1 AU. One 10-40 kHz receiver measures radio and plasma waves near the 1 AU electron plasma frequency. One receiver makes high time resolution measurements at 50 MHz. Time Domain Samplers make simultaneous wideband waveform measurements on three electric components. Antenna systems include three mutually orthogonal 6-meter monopoles.",
