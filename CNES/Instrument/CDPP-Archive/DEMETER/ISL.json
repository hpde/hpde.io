        "Description": "The Langmuir probe experiment (ISL), has been designed for in situ measurements of the bulk parameters of the ionospheric thermal plasma. The ISL instrument is comprised of two sensors: (i) a classical cylindrical sensor and (ii) a spherical sensor with its surface divided in seven segments: six spherical caps electrically isolated and the rest of the sphere which is used as a guard electrode. The two main parameters measured by ISL are the electron density and temperature. They are obtained with a 1  s time-resolution. \n\nLebreton et al. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pss.2005.10.017",
