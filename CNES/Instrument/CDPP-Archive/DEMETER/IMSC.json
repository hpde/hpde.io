        "Description": "The magnetic field experiment IMSC is composed of 3 orthogonal magnetic antennae (search coil type) linked to a pre-amplifier unit with a shielded cable of 80cm.  The search coil magnetometer consists of a core in permalloy (high permeability material) on which are wound a main coil with several thousand turns (12000) of copper wire and a secondary coil with a few turns. The core is a 170 mm rod with a 4 x 4 mm cross-section.",
