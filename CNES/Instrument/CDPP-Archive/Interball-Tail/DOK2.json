        "Description": "The DOK-2 instrument measures energetic electron (28-400 keV) and ion (20-850 keV) spectra in the Earth's magnetosphere both on Tail and Auroral probes. It has 2 pairs of energetic particles telescopes. The 1-st pair of telescopes (1e, 1p) was directed at theta=180° to the satellite spin axis. For the 2-nd pair (2e, 2p) this angle can be set by commands to 45°, 90°, 135° or 180° or can change continuously from 45 to 180° in the scanning mode. The great majority of measurements were done at fixed values theta=62° (Tail) and 79° (Auroral Probe).\n\nOn the Tail Probe :\n\n    The 1e, 1p and 2p-telescopes worked normally till the end of mission.\n\n    The 2e-telescope worked normally :\n\n    - from the mission begin (05.08.95) to 11.09.95 18:50 UT,\n\n    - from 31.12.95 07:01:44 UT to 28.02.96 17:25 UT,\n\n    - 03.02.97 from 15:30 to 15:40 UT,\n\n    - 18.02.97,from 20:30 to 21:16 UT. \n\nOn the Auroral probe :\n\n    Shortly after the mission began, the 1e detector noise increased and this telescope was switched off.\n    Noise of other telescopes increased significantly after April 1998 due to radiation damage and the data after this time were not processed.  \n\nThe output parameters are :\n\n- full energetic spectra of electrons and ions\n\n- time profile parameters (total particle intensities in the 3 narrow energy intervals for each telescope).\n\nBoth for spectra and time profiles, the time interval dT of each measurement was variable and was determined by a special algorithm.",
