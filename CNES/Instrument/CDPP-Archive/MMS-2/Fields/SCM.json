        "Description": "The tri-axial Search-Coil Magnetometer (SCM) belongs to the The FIELDS Instrument Suite on MMS. It provides the three magnetic components of the waves from 1 Hz to 6 kHz in particular in the key regions of the Earth's magnetosphere namely the subsolar region and the magnetotail.\n\nThe SCM consists of a tri-axial set of magnetic sensors with its associated preamplifier box.\nThe SCM sensor is mounted on the same five meter boom as the Analog Flux-Gate magnetometer (AFG), 4 meters from the spacecraft and 1 meter from AFG. The SCM preamplifier box is mounted on the spacecraft deck (outside of the central electronics box) near the base of the AFG/SCM magnetometer boom.\nThe SCM preamplifier is connected to the digital signal processor (DSP) which digitizes and processes the three analog waveforms delivered by SCM. Once per orbit, the DSP injects to SCM a calibration signal. A thermistance mounted on the SCM structure provides the temperature of the SCM sensor (housekeeping).",
