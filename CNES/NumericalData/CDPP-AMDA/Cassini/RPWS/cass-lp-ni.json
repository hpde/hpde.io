The data reduction method is described in detail in Holmberg et al. 2012 and Holmberg et al. 2017.\n            The Cassini RPWS/LP data are available at the University of Iowa and the Swedish Institute of Space Physics. The Swedish National Space Board (SNSB) supports the RPWS/LP instrument on board Cassini.",

Occasionally the fit to the sweep is not very good. Usually a data point with an error 3 times the estimated value or larger is considered a bad data point, but this has to be evaluated from case to case. A good way to do this is to compare with the electron density derived from the upper hybrid resonance frequency or with the ion density obtained from CAPS measurements. The data can also be compared to previous measurements from the same region which should show similar densities.\n            Note that data is very irregular.",
