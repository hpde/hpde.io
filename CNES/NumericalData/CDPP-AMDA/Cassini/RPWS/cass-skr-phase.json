        "Description": "The Saturn Kilometric Radiation (SKR) is an intense non-thermal radio emission produced in auroral regions by accelerated electrons moving along magnetic field lines, predominantly on the dawn sector. Its regular pulsation, whose origin remains unexplained yet, was originally interpreted as a clock-like rotational modulation triggered by the planetary magnetic field, and thus directly relating to the planetary interior.               \n               South and North SKR periods have been computed separately by Dr.Laurent Lamy (Observatory of Paris/LESIA). \n                For each kronian hemisphere (North and South), the following parameters are available:\n                * period : SKR dominant period in hours\n                * phi : SKR phase system (in which SKR maxima peak about 0deg)\n                * drift: SKR peak phase with respect to an arbitrary period (10.7928h in S and 10.6h in N)\n",
