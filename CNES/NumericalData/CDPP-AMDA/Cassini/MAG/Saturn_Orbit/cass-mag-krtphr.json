      "Caveats": "These data contain persistent noise signals at 0.2, 8, 16 Hz, and associated  \nharmonics. This noise was not observed during ground testing of the           \ninstruments and is anticipated to be interference arising from the spacecraft.\nRemoval of these signals is at the user's discretion.\n\n\nThere are errors in some of the Cassini MAG data in this data set  \ndue to incorrect handling of leapseconds. The errors are as follows:                                                                           \n* 2012-07-01 00:00:00.000 - 2015-07-01 00:00:00.000 - Error : +1 s\n* 2015-07-01 00:00:00.000 - 2017-01-01 00:00:00.000 - Error : +2 s\n* 2017-01-01 00:00:00.000 - End of Mission - Error : +13 s\n                                                                              \nThe time tags can be corrected by subtracting the error from current time     \nvalues. This error was created during the conversion of the data from binary  \nto ASCII performed at the PDS/PPI node. It does not exist in the original     \nbinary data files available from the Cassini MAG team. The PPI node will      \ncorrect this error in it's data holdings at a future date.\n\n\nSome versions of these data were determined to contain timing errors,         \nincluding both backwards and repeated times. These timing errors have not     \nbeen corrected in the data files.\nA full list of all files, and intervals containing timing errors is provided  \nbelow: \n* 2003-09-11T00:02:02.439\t2003-09-11T00:02:18.390\tbackwards\n* 2005-12-31T15:48:07.169\t2005-12-31T23:59:59.888\tbackwards\n* 2006-05-30T00:19:41.029\t2006-05-30T00:20:04.996\tbackwards\n* 2007-08-01T07:17:10.921\t2007-08-01T07:17:18.855\tbackwards\n* 2007-12-19T00:00:01.631\t2007-12-19T00:35:28.919\tbackwards\n* 2007-12-27T00:00:00.033\t2007-12-27T00:00:20.000\tbackwards\n* 2008-03-12T00:00:11.701\t2008-03-12T00:00:19.636\tbackwards\n* 2008-05-04T00:00:13.407\t2008-05-04T00:00:29.276\tbackwards\n* 2008-05-27T00:00:05.382\t2008-05-27T00:00:21.251\tbackwards\n* 2009-01-24T00:00:03.583\t2009-01-24T00:00:07.550\tbackwards\n* 2009-02-21T00:00:15.395\t2009-02-21T00:00:23.330\tbackwards\n* 2009-04-28T00:00:06.869\t2009-04-28T00:00:22.804\tbackwards\n* 2009-07-24T00:00:14.454\t2009-07-24T00:00:22.388\tbackwards\n* 2009-09-28T09:41:09.839\t2009-09-28T09:41:29.806\tbackwards\n* 2009-12-19T00:05:02.755\t2009-12-19T00:05:06.722\tbackwards\n* 2010-04-29T00:00:00.632\t2010-04-29T00:00:12.099\tbackwards\n* 2011-11-19T00:00:02.492\t2011-11-19T00:00:18.427\tbackwards\n* 2012-04-16T00:00:01.932\t2012-04-16T00:00:09.866\tbackwards\n* 2012-09-26T13:55:34.270\t2012-09-26T13:55:58.204\tbackwards\n* 2013-06-11T00:00:02.033\t2013-06-11T00:00:17.902\tbackwards\n* 2015-01-15T00:00:02.704\t2015-01-15T00:00:18.573\tbackwards\n* 2015-11-07T00:00:04.341\t2015-11-07T00:00:20.276\tbackwards\n* 2016-06-07T00:00:15.522\t2016-06-07T09:21:56.395\tbackwards\n* 2017-03-12T17:00:26.474\t2017-03-12T18:21:12.765\tbackwards\n",
