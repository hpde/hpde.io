Velocity  and  temperature  \n            are  also  provided  as  components  perpendicular  and parallel  to  the  magnetic field. \n            The  magnetic  field  data  is  taken  from  CSDS  FGM  PP  data,  at  present.  In  a  possible  future \n            release  we would  ideally  use CAA  FGM  data,  but  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  there  will  be  major  differences  except  in \n            very weak field regions.

        sensors can be made in the moments production software; in the first release the moments are made using LEEA data in the

        In some situations, use of both sensors together may be a better choice, for example in case
        s where the  distribution  changes 
        during  a  spin  as  the  method  can  resolve  time  aliasing  errors.  If  resources  allow,  the  Moments 
        product at CAA may be updated to take advantage of this possibility.
        The  advantage  of  these  ground  - calculated  moments  is  that  the  best  available 
        calibration  data  is  used,  a  correction  can  be made  for  the  spacecraft  potential
        measurements  (collected  by  the  EFW  experiment),  and  spacecraft  electrons  can  be 
        properly  removed.  The  current  release  has  been  generated  automatically  
        using  default  values  to  control  the  approach  to 
        potential correction and photoelectron removal, and has not been systematically human
        - validated, so some errors may exist. 
        Specifically, the spacecraft potential, Vsc, is set to be 1 V greater than the
        measured probe - spacecraft potential provided by 
        the electric field experiment (EFW) and the lower energy cutoff for the  moments
        integration is set to reject the energy bin 
        containing  the  EFW  potential  and  the  one  above  that  (which  in  practice  
        may  also  contain  counts  due  to  spacecraft electrons). 
        Sometimes cold electrons are present which can appear in the same energy bin as the spacecraft photoelectrons, 
        therefore  both the  cold electrons and spacecraft photoelectrons are  removed resulting in underestimated electron densities. 
        Recent  work
        by  the  EFW  team  suggests  a  more  accurate  determination  of  from  would  be  a  term  that  increases  linearly 
        above  ~10  V  (Cully  et  al.,  2007)  but  this  has  not  yet  been  
        implemented  in  our  CAA  moments  generation  code.</code></pre>
