        "Description": " Electric Field in ISR2 is obtained from CAA C[1-4]_CP_EFW_L3_E \n                \n                The EFW instrument measures the electric field only in the spacecraft \n                spin plane, therefore a spin-plane oriented coordinate system is best suited for scientific studies involving the electric field. The ISR2 (Inverted Spin Reference) system, also known as DSI (Despun System Inverted), is such a system. The X and Y axes are in the spin plane, with X pointing as near sunward as possible and Y perpendicular to the sunward direction, positive towards dusk. The Z-axis is along the (negative) spacecraft spin axis, towards the north ecliptic. The coordinate system is called Inverted because the actual spin axis of Cluster is pointing towards the south ecliptic. The difference between ISR2 (DSI) and the GSE (Geocentric Solar Ecliptic) is a tilt of 2° to 7° of the Z-axis performed in order\n                to avoid shading of the EFW probes by the spacecraft.\n                Note\n                : The ISR2 and GSE systems differ substantially on C3 during the May 2008 \n                tilt campaign (between 09:00 UT on 2008-04-25 and 08:24 UT on 2008-05-30), \n                when the spin axis of C3 was deliberately tilted by up to 45 degrees about the x \n                axis.\n                \n                \n                Data quality description : \n                * 4 : Excellent data which have received special treatment\n                * 3 : Good for publication, subject to PI approval\n                * 2 : Survey data, not for publication\n                * 1 : Known problems, use at your own risk\n                * 0 : Bad data\n            ",
