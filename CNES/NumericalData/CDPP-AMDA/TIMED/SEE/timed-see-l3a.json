Level 3A does \nnot remove flares, so it is useful for short-term flare studies.    \n         ",

SEE Level 3A data files also contain  \n38 emission lines extracted from EGS Level 2A spectra, and the XPS  \nLevel 2A diode irradiances. \n\nFor normal operations, SEE observes the Sun for about 3 minutes every orbit (97 minutes), which usually gives 14-15  \nmeasurements per day. The SEE Level 3A data are time averaged over each observation, \nafter applying corrections for atmospheric absorption, \ndegradation, and to 1-AU (no flare removal). A suborbital (sounding \nrocket) payload is flown approximately once a year for TIMED SEE \nabsolute calibrations.  The first SEE suborbital calibration flight was \non Feb. 8, 2002, the second was on Aug. 12, 2003, the third was \non Oct. 15, 2004, the fourth was on Oct. 28, 2006, and the final \nSEE calibration flight was on Apr. 14, 2008.
