        "Description": "SuperMAG is a worldwide collaboration of organizations and national agencies that currently operate more than 300 ground based magnetometers. SuperMAG provides easy access to validated ground magnetic field perturbations in the same coordinate system, identical time resolution and with a common baseline removal approach.\n\nSuperMAG utilizes 3D vector measurements of the magnetic field obtained from ground bases magnetometers. Stations providing absolute measurements (e.g. Intermagnet Observatories) as well as stations providing relative measurements are included. SuperMAG is focused on the variations caused by electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere and hence subtracts the dominant and slowly varying Earth main field.\n\nSuperMAG service includes data with two different temporal resolution, 1-min and 1-sec. The latter is a subset of the former as not all stations provide 1-sec data. The 1-min data and all derived products can be accessed by selecting the 'Low Fidelity' option under Indices, Data, Polar Plots, Movies and Products. The 1-sec data and all derived products can be accessed by selecting the 'High Fidelity' option under Data and Polar Plots.\n\nMore information and details are available in Gjerloev [2009] and Gjerloev [2012].",
