        "Description": "Each spectrum is composed of 15 differential flux measurements, each made     \n0.4 seconds. The plasma instrument included 15 energy channels spaced         \nlogarithmically between 13.4 eV and 687 eV where the fractional width in      \nenergy (Delta E)/E was 6.6 percent. The field of view of the instrument       \nwas fan-shaped. The instrument was scanned at a rate of about one degree      \nper second through an arc of 120 degrees centered on a direction that         \nwas 6.5 degrees east of the spacecraft-sun line. The field of view is         \n+/- 3.5 degrees in the scan plane and +/- 13.5 degrees perpendicular to       \n\t\t that plane [OGILVIEETAL1974]\n\t ",
