        "Description": "Plasma density derived from individual spacecraft \npotential measurements on one illuminated probe. The derivation additionally \nuses low time resolution estimates of the plasma density from either RPCLAP or \nRPCMIP (changes over time).  The data here are derived from the LAP \nVsc proxy known as U_SC which is available over all the mission, and \nare calibrated to MIP density values after 2014-12-31. Before this period the MIP \ndensity detections were scarce since densities usually were low, so the LAP \nsweep parameter N_E from ASW dataset was used for the calibration of U_SC to N_ED. \nThis is a good calibration source precisely when MIP data are scarce, as low plasma density \nmeans low s/c potential, meaning that the otherwise very negative spacecraft potential here \ndoes not prevent plasma electrons from reaching the Langmuir probes.\n\nThis is a preliminary data set which will be replaced by another in a few months.\n ",

Note that these constants are chosen such that every digit represents up to three true/false values for the presence/absence of three specific separate quality-related effects.\n* Should the three quality-related effects be irrelevant for the given data product, then that digit is replaced by the digit “9”.\n\nQuality flag event description :\n* +1 - Low quality sweep analysis model fit\n* +2 - One of two meanings: (1) Low sample size; an average is based on fewer data points than nominal (due to filtering or otherwise) and applies to sweep steps and downsampled time series. (2) zero-padding; zeros replace lost samples for the purpose of calculating PSD.\n* +10 - One of two meanings: (1) Sweep data product and data products based on sweeps: SAA rotation of more than 0.05° during sweep. (2) Downsampled time series data product: Bias change within the 32 s downsampling period.\n* +20 - Probe in partial or full shadow\n* +100 - Rosetta wheel off-loading (WOL) or Orbit-control-maneuver (OCM)\n* +200 - One of two meanings: (1) For LAP1: LDL disturbance (LAP2 in LDL mode); (2) For LAP2: Contamination signature possibly present\n* +400 - Saturation\n\nExample: suppose that one encounters the quality flag “109”. 109 = 100 + 9 means (1) that there is an ongoing wheel off-loading (+100), and (2) that the quality-related effects associated with +1 and +2 cannot occur even in principle for the kind of data that one is looking at.           \n",
