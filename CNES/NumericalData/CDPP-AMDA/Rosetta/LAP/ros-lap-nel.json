Note that these constants are chosen such that every digit represents up to three true/false values for the presence/absence of three specific separate quality-related effects.\n            * Should the three quality-related effects be irrelevant for the given data product, then that digit is replaced by the digit “9”.\n            \n            Quality flag event description :\n            * +1 - Low quality sweep analysis model fit\n            * +2 - One of two meanings: (1) Low sample size; an average is based on fewer data points than nominal (due to filtering or otherwise) and applies to sweep steps and downsampled time series. (2) zero-padding; zeros replace lost samples for the purpose of calculating PSD.\n            * +10 - One of two meanings: (1) Sweep data product and data products based on sweeps: SAA rotation of more than 0.05° during sweep. (2) Downsampled time series data product: Bias change within the 32 s downsampling period.\n            * +20 - Probe in partial or full shadow\n            * +100 - Rosetta wheel off-loading (WOL) or Orbit-control-maneuver (OCM)\n            * +200 - One of two meanings: (1) For LAP1: LDL disturbance (LAP2 in LDL mode); (2) For LAP2: Contamination signature possibly present\n            * +400 - Saturation\n            \n            Example: suppose that one encounters the quality flag “109”. 109 = 100 + 9 means (1) that there is an ongoing wheel off-loading (+100), and (2) that the quality-related effects associated with +1 and +2 cannot occur even in principle for the kind of data that one is looking at.                       \n",
