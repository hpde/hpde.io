        "Description": "\nThe two LAP probes could be used to measure the component of the electric field along their \nseparation vector, by measuring the voltage of them, taking the difference and dividing by the \nseparation distance (5.0 m). Each probe could be fed by a bias current as is typically done on \nelectric field instruments in tenuous plasmas, or be disconnected from the bias circuitry to \nensure a good zero bias current (floating probes) as is typically done on sounding rockets.  \nBias currents were used in the early part of the mission, but when the comet ionosphere \ndeveloped, the floating mode was found to give much more consistent data. Only data from \nthe floating mode have been used for providing E-field data, and only when both probes are \nsunlit.\n\nPositive value refers to electric field  pointing in the direction from probe 1 to probe 2.\n \nThe booms are not equal in length (2.24 and 1.62 m) and mounted on a big spacecraft (solar \npanel wingspan 32 m), so one cannot expect LAP to provide a useful DC electric field estimate. \nA moving average of the E-field over 32 s is therefore subtracted from the data in the EFL files. \nThe effective bandwidth of the data therefore is about 0.03 Hz to 20 Hz, the upper \nlimit set by the analog anti-aliasing filters. Note that the filtering may distort the lowest \nfrequencies. \n\nThere are no external comparison data for assessing the absolute accuracy of the LAP E-field \nmeasurements. The data themselves look very clean and well behaved [Karlsson et al., 2017; \nAndré et al, 2017], with very little of common mode signal remaining, despite the s/c poten tial \nbeing both high and highly variable. The technique with floating probes is proven on numerous \nsounding rockets in the terrestrial ionosphere [Maynard, 1998].\n\nThis is a preliminary data set which will be replaced by another in a few months.\n",
