Preliminary, 5-min averages.\n         Parameters include proton density, temperature (radial component) and flow speed, \n         flow velocity vector in GSE, GSM and RTN coordinates, and alpha to proton density ratio. \n         AMDA presents temperature in eV. The ram pressure is calculated using P=rho*Np*Vp², where rho=1.672622*(1+4*(1/(1-He++_ratio)-1)). \n         We use rho=2 here, which corresponds to a ratio of He++ between 4% and 5%.\n      ",

This is especially true if the appropriate ACE team members are not consulted before publication. At the very least, preprints should be forwarded to the ACE team before publication.\n   ",
