        "Description": "This data set contains ARCAD-3 TBF magnetometer data and filter-bank data (filter information, frequencies, component, unit, reliability flag, amplitude).\nThe TBF experiment onboard the AUREOL3 satellite (ARCAD3 project) was designed to measure two electric and three magnetic wave field components in the range from 10 Hz to 16 kHz. Two telemetry systems were available on AUREOL3, real-time telemetry (TMF) and tape-recorded telemetry (TMS). The Filter-Bank data, related to the TMS one, cover the Earth in geographical coordinates. Four TMS modes ZAP1, ZAP2, ZAP3, ZAP4 were used with the respective filter sampling intervals of 0.01, 0.08, 0.32 and 2.56 seconds.\nThree types of filters were used, FB, FBF and FBS. The two electric components EH and EZ are processed in a bank of six filters named FB with center frequencies of 15, 32, 72, 150, 325 and 725 Hz. Two components, among the two electric and the three magnetic components, were selected and fed two identical sets of seven adjacent wide-band (FBF) and five spaced narrow-band (FBS) filters. The center frequencies of the FBF are 250, 700, 1250, 2200, 3900, 7000 and 12500 Hz. The center frequencies of the FBS are 140, 450, 800, 4500 and 15000 Hz. All the output filter amplitudes are given in physical units, mV/m/(Hz)^-2 for the electric field and nT/(Hz)^-2 for the magnetic field.\nData use\nTBF data presented in the 'Filter-Bank' archive have to be validated prior to any interpretation. Questionable electric and magnetic field data can be due to :\n    telemetry noise,\n    calibrations performed every 128 seconds,\n    possible saturation of the input electronics (ULF turbulence),\n    wrong gain variations,\n    amplitude values equal to zero although the reliability and mode flags are correct.\nConcerning the ancillary data, for several sets, the orbit parameters can be equal to zero even the related flag is correctly set (OK_AUXI).\nThe reliability of the recorded formats is given with the flag OK_VALID or PB_VALID.\nThe reliability of the filter data (filter commutation) is given with the flag OK_MODE or PB_MODE.",
