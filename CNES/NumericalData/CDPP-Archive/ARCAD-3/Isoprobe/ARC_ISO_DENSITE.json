        "Description": "This data set contains electron density and temperature from ARCAD-3 Isoprobe experiment. \nThe plasma frequency (and hence the electron density) is determined from the frequency of one or several resonance peaks. For high plasma density, the frequency response exhibits only one peak located at the upper hybrid frequency. For low density plasma, the determination is more complicated since the frequency response is influenced by the magnetic field, and multiple resonances can be observed. A specific chart has been created to take into account all the main resonances as upper hybrid, plasma and Bernstein mode frequencies.\nThe Debye length (and hence the electron temperature, knowing the density) has been determined from the amplitude of the main resonance peaks. A chart has been created to allow an estimation of the Debye length as a function of the amplitude and of the plasma frequency.\nFor high density plasma, electron temperature can also be determined from the frequency interference pattern above the upper hybrid resonance.\nThe resolution is a few seconds (low time resolution), depending on the type of telemetry.",
