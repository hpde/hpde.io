        "Description": "This Event Table  shows the telecomand status of the WHISPER sounder on the Cluster-1 spacecraft when active (i.e., sounding).\n For each time interval, the following information is provided : \n\ntime_tags__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT: An ISO time range which indicates the time interval t2-t1 of the sounding mode event (same WHISPER command state).  More precisely t1 is the time of the first pulse of the current WHISPER sounder command state, and t2 the time of the first pulse of the following WHISPER sounder command state (or of the last sounder pulse of the day)\nTable_Number__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : the selected Frequency Table Number between 0 and 127\nGain_Command__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT :\nThe gain command number \n    0  fixed gain +12dB\n    1  fixed gain +24dB\n    2  fixed gain +36dB\n    3  fixed gain +36dB\n    4  automatic gain +24/+12 dB\n    5  automatic gain +24/+12\n    6  automatic gain +36/+24\n    7  automatic gain +36/+24 dB\nLevel__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : The peak-to-peak value of the emission pulse (V)\nReceiving_Antenna__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : Receiving antenna Ey or Ez\nSmode_average__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : Time interval between two successive emission pulses in units of 40/3 (=13.3) ms. \n    0: 1 unit (13.3 ms)\n    1: 2 units (26.6 ms)\n    2: 3 units (40 ms)\n    3: 5 units (66.6 ms)\n    4: 8 units (106.6 ms)\n    5: 40 units + 2106.66 ms waiting + 256 units + 2446.66 ms waiting = (8.5 s)\n    6: 6 units + 45 ms waiting (125 ms)\n    7: 14 units + 63.34 ms waiting (250 ms)\nWhisper_Processing__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : This variable is equal to 1 if Whisper processing is ON and 0 otherwise (DWP compression of Whisper data) (case of Whisper processing is unfrequent (or inexistant))\nEmission_Reception_Delay__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : Delay between the leading edge of the emission pulse and the starting edge of the associated reception (acquisition time interval)\nForm_Passive_Reduced_Flag__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT :\n   0: do form\n   1: don't form. To form reduced spectrum means to add 6 successive frequency bins.\nSounding_Processing_Option__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : Compression strategy (A,B,C,D)\nCompression_Method_Required__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT :\n    0 if the exponent size is adjusted \n    1 the exponent size is fixed to 5\nCompressed_Data_Size__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT: \n    0 if the compressed data size is equal to 8 bits \n    1 if the compressed data size is equal to 6 bits\nPulse_Table__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : This table contains 80 values qualifying each pulse of the sounding sweep.Value is\n   0 if the corresponding pulse duration is 1.024 ms\n   1 if the corresponding pulse duration is equal to 0.512 ms and \n -1 for no pulse (sweep table with less than 80 emissions)\nTime_Delay__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : This variable contains 512 values, each value corresponds to the time difference (positive or negative) between the pulse time and the swept table interval centred time.\nSpectral_Frequencies__C1_CT_WHI_ACTIVE_EVENT : Spectral Frequencies between 1.953 and 79.915 kHz, that is to say the frequencies corresponding point to point to the 512 elements of the fixed size spectrum.  IMPORTANT This table is global, the table of values is repeated in each individual records, but is provided globally in the metadata header of this dataset.",
