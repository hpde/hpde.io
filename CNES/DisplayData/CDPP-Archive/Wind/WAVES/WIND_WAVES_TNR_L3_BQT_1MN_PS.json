        "Description": "This data set contains WIND WAVES TNR L3 Quasi-Thermal Noise Data plots.\nTwo methods have been used to derive the electron density from the quasi-thermal noise measurements of the Waves Thermal Noise Receiver.\nLevel 3 data from the Thermal Noise Receiver consists of values of the electron density derived by two different methods of ground processing of Level 2 (calibrated) data.\nThis data set interpolates the observed spectra onto spectra calculated from a model electron phase-space distribution with four free parameters, each of which is thus determined.\nThey give the plasma frequency in kHz, the electronic core distribution temperature in eV, the ratio between electronic halo and core distributions density and temperature, computed via a least square fit of the observed spectra.\nThe proton temperature and the solar wind velocity issued from the Wind-3DP experiment are aslo given.\nThe model uses 6 parameters and precision on each ones are also recorded in the files, as such as a root-mean square between fitted and observed spectra.\nA precision of zero means that the associated parameter is not adjusted.\nData are organized as temporal series.\nTemporal resolution is one-minute average data.",
