        "Description": "The TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) mission is studying the influences \n        of the Sun and humans on the least explored and understood region of Earth's atmosphere - the Mesosphere and Lower \n        Thermosphere/Ionosphere (MLTI). \n        The MLTI region is a gateway between Earth's environment and space, where the Sun's energy is first \n        deposited into Earth's environment. TIMED is focusing on a portion of this atmospheric region located approximately \n        40-110 miles (60-180 kilometers) above the surface.",
