        "Description": "Juno will improve our understanding of the solar system's beginnings by revealing the origin and evolution of Jupiter.\n\nSpecifically, Juno will…\n\n   * Determine how much water is in Jupiter's atmosphere, which helps determine which planet formation theory is correct (or if new theories are needed)\n   *  Look deep into Jupiter's atmosphere to measure composition, temperature, cloud motions and other properties\n   *  Map Jupiter's magnetic and gravity fields, revealing the planet's deep structure\n   * Explore and study Jupiter's magnetosphere near the planet's poles, especially the auroras – Jupiter's northern and southern lights – providing new insights about how the planet's enormous magnetic force field affects its atmosphere.\n    ",
