        "Description": "Freja was launched on October 6th 1992 as a \"piggyback\" payload on a Long March 2D (CZ-2C) rocket from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in China. \n      The satellite is in an orbit between 601 and 1756 km at 63Â° inclination. Freja is a sun-pointing spinner with a 2.2 m diameter and 214kg dry mass. \n      Freja images the aurora and measures particles and fields in the upper ionosphere and lower magnetosphere. The satellie has been in operation for more than 1000 days.\n      \n      Instruments : \n      * (F1) Electric Fields, Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden\n      * (F2) Magnetic Fields, Applied Physics Laboratory/Johns Hopkins University, United States\n      * (F3C) Cold Plasma, National Research Council of Canada, Canada\n      * (F3H) Particles; Hot Plasma, Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Kiruna, Sweden\n      * (F4) Waves, Swedish Institute of Space Physics, Uppsala, Sweden\n      * (F5) Auroral Imager, University of Calgary, Canada\n      * (F6) Electron Beam, Max-Planck Institute, Germany\n      * (F7) Particle Correlator, Max-Planck Institute, Germany",
