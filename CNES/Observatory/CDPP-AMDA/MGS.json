        "Description": "The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) orbited Mars over a seven year period and \n        collected data on the surface morphology, topography, composition, gravity, \n        atmospheric dynamics, and magnetic field. This data is used to investigate the \n        surface processes, geology, distribution of material, internal properties, \n        evolution of the magnetic field, and the weather and climate of Mars.\n\nAfter aerobraking ended in February 1999, MGS was in a 118 minute circular polar science \nmapping orbit with an index altitude of 378 km. The orbit is sun-synchronous \n(2 a.m./2 p.m.) and maps over the 2 p.m. crossing from south to north (\ninstead of north to south as originally planned). The orbit has a 7 day near-repeat cycle \nso Mars will be mapped in 26 day cycles. Science mapping began in mid-March 1999, which was \nsummer in the northern hemisphere on Mars. The primary mission lasted one martian year \n(687 Earth days) through January, 2001. An extended mission took place until April 2002, \nfurther extensions were added until contact with the spacecraft was lost on 2 November 2006.\n",
