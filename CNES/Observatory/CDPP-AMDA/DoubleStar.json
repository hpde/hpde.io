        "Description": "The Double Star mission was a unique scientific collaboration between Europe and China. For the first time, two Chinese \n        spacecraft carried suites of instruments provided by European scientists and funded by European governments and ESA.\n        \nDouble Star follows in the footsteps of ESA's ground-breaking Cluster mission by studying the effects of the Sun on \nthe Earth's environment. Conducting joint studies with Cluster and Double Star increases the overall scientific\nreturn from both missions.As its name suggests, Double Star involves two satellites - each designed, developed, launched,\nand operated by the China National Space Administration (CNSA). \n\nThe two spacecraft are called TC-1 and TC-2, where TC stands for 'Tan Ce' which means 'Explorer'.",
