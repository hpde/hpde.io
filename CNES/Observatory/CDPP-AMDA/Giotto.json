        "Description": ">ESA's first deep space mission, Giotto was designed to help solve the mysteries \nsurrounding Comet Halley by passing as close as possible to the comet's nucleus, \nwhich it achieved on 14 March 1986 at a distance of just under 600 km. No-one\nexpected the spacecraft to survive its battering from comet dust during this encounter,\nbut although Giotto was damaged during the flyby, most of its instruments remained operational.\nThe mission was extended to allow a additional encounter with comet Grigg-Skjellerup on 10 July 1992, at a\ndistance of around 200 km.",
