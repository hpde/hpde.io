        "Description": "The OMNI observatory is a virtual observatory representing the collection of spacecraft used in the creation of the OMNI datasets.  \n            The observatories used within the OMNI datasets are ACE, Wind, IMP8, Geotail, GOES and various other spacecraft. For any given time period \n            OMNI uses a selection criteria to select the \"best\" available data to be used.  Thus, a data record may consist of data from multiple\n            observatories.  Without looking at each data record it is not possible to tell which observatories contributed. As result, the OMNI \n            observatories is used as a proxy for the set of possible contributing observatories. Complete details on the instruments and the \n            selection criteria are available at the Information URLs listed below.",
