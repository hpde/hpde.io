After an Earth flyby July-August, 2005, Venus flybys October-November, 2006, and May-June, 2007, and Mercury flybys December 2007 - January 2008, September-October, 2008, and September-October, 2009, \n MESSENGER entered Mercury orbit 2011-03-04.  Much data of interest to\n the heliospheric community was obtained during the cruise phases \n between planetary encounters from a magnetometer and an energetic \n particle and plasma spectrometer.",
