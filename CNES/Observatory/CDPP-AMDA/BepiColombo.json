        "Description": "BepiColombo is Europe's first mission to Mercury. \n        It will set off in 2018 on a journey to the smallest and least explored terrestrial planet in our \n        Solar System. When it arrives at Mercury in late 2025, it will \n        endure temperatures in excess of 350 Â°C and gather data during its 1 year nominal mission, \n        with a possible 1-year extension. The mission comprises two spacecraft: the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) \n        and the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO). BepiColombo is a joint mission between ESA and the Japan Aerospace \n        Exploration Agency (JAXA), executed under ESA leadership.    \n       ",
