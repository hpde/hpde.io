        "Description": "MMS consists of four identical spacecraft that orbit around Earth through the dynamic \n                 magnetic system surrounding our planet to study a little-understood phenomenon called \n                 magnetic reconnection.\n                 * MMS was launched on March 12, 2015.\n                 * MMS includes 4 identically instrumented MMS spacecraft fly in an adjustable pyramid-like formation that enables them to observe microphysics processes like electron diffusion region, three-dimensional structure of magnetic reconnection, complex thin current structures, and more.\n      ",
