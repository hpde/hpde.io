MAVEN is a satellite optimised for determining the role that loss of volatile compounds—such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and water—from Mars' atmosphere to space has played through time, giving insight into the history of Mars' atmosphere and climate, liquid water, and planetary habitability.\n        It arrived at Mars in September 2014 and continued operating for more than two years.        \n      ",
