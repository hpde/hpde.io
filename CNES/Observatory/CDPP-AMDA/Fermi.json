        "Description": "The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, \n        formerly called the Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), \n        is a space observatory being used to perform gamma-ray astronomy observations from low Earth orbit. \n        Its main instrument is the Large Area Telescope (LAT), with which astronomers mostly intend to perform an all-sky \n        survey studying astrophysical and cosmological phenomena such as active galactic nuclei, pulsars, other high-energy sources \n        and dark matter. Another instrument aboard Fermi, the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM; formerly GLAST Burst Monitor), is being used to \n        study gamma-ray bursts.\n      \n      NASA has teamed up with the U.S. Department of Energy and institutions in France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Sweden. General Dynamics was \n      chosen to build the spacecraft. Fermi was launched June 11, 2008 at 12:05 pm EDT.",
