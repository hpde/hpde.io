      <Description>Jason-3 is the fourth mission in U.S.-European series of satellite missions that measure the 
        height of the ocean surface. Launched on January 17, 2016, the mission will extend the time series of 
        ocean surface topography measurements (the hills and valleys of the ocean surface) begun by the 
        TOPEX/Poseidon satellite mission in 1992 and continuing through the Jason-1 (launched in 2001) and 
        the currently operating OSTM/Jason-2 (launched in 2008) missions. These measurements provide scientists 
        with critical information about circulation patterns in the ocean and about both global and 
        regional changes in sea level and the climate implications of a warming world.
        
        The primary instrument on Jason-3 is a radar altimeter. The altimeter will measure sea-level 
        variations over the global ocean with very high accuracy (as 1.3 inches or 3.3 centimeters, with a 
        goal of achieving 1 inch or 2.5 centimeters). Continual, long-term, reliable data of changes 
        in ocean surface topography will be generated and will be used by scientists and operational 
        agencies (NOAA, European weather agencies, marine operators, etc.) for scientific research and operational 
        oceanography for the benefit of society.
        TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason-1 were cooperative missions between NASA and the French space agency, CNES. 
        Additional partners in the Jason-2 mission included NOAA and Eumetsat. Jason-3 continues the 
        international cooperation, with NOAA and Eumetsat leading the efforts, along with partners NASA and CNES.
        The mission objectives are:
        
        1) Provide continuity of high precision ocean topography measurements beyond TOPEX/Poseidon , 
        JASON-1 and JASON-2
        
        2) Provide an operational mission to enable the continuation of multi-decadal ocean topography measurements
        
        3) The science requirements call for a global sea surface height to an accuracy lower than 4 cm every 10 
        days for determining days, ocean circulation, climate change and sea level rise.
