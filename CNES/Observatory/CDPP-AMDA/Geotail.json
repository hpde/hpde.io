        "Description": "The GEOTAIL mission is a collaborative project undertaken by the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), \n        Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). \n        The Geotail spacecraft was designed and built by ISAS and was launched on July 24, 1992. \n        After fulfilling Its original objective of studying the dynamics of the Earth's magnetotail over a wide range of distance, \n        extending from the near-Earth region (8 Earth radii (Re) from the Earth) to the distant tail (about 200 Re) its orbit was changed. \n        Since February 1995 Geotail has been in an elliptical 9 by 30 Re orbit where it has provided data on most aspects of the solar wind \n        interaction with the magnetosphere.           \n      ",
