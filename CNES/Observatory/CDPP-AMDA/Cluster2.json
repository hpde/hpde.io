        "Description": "\n        Cluster II is part of an international collaboration to investigate the physical connection between the Sun and Earth. Flying in a tetrahedral (triangular pyramid) formation, the four spacecraft collect the most detailed data yet on small-scale changes in near-Earth space and the interaction between the charged particles of the solar wind and Earth's atmosphere. This enables scientists to build a three-dimensional model of the magnetosphere and to better understand the processes taking place inside it.\n      ",
