The spacecraft went into a near-polar orbit on 06-May-2006, with apogee and perigee altitudes of 66,000 km and 250 km (10.9 and 0.04 Venus radii). The main goal of the mission is to conduct a comprehensive study of the atmosphere of Venus and to examine the plasma environment and the interaction between the upper atmosphere and the solar wind. \nInstruments carried on Venus Express are: \n-  the Venus Monitoring Camera, a wide angle imager\n- ASPERA, a combined energetic neutral atom imager, ion, and electron spectrometer, and magnetometer\n-  PFS, an IR Fourier spectrometer\n- SPICAV/SOIR, a UV/IR spectrometer\n- VIRTIS, a UV, visible, IR imaging spectrometer\n- MAG, a suite of two magnetometers, and VeRa, a radio science experiment.",
