        "Description": "The main scientific objective of the low altitude DEMETER micro-satellite was to study the ionospheric disturbances that can occur before major earthquakes.\nThe DEMETER micro-satellite was launched on 29 June 2004 into a circular and polar orbit at an altitude of 715 km. Its scientific objectives were to study both the ionospheric disturbances that can occur before major earthquakes and the ionospheric changes induced by human activity (radio-navigation transmitters, electromagnetic radiation from industrial activity).\nThe scientific payload included instruments to measure waves in a wide frequency range, electronic and ionic densities, and energetic particles.",
