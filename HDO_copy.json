        "Description": "\n    Heliophysics research often requires the use of\n    a variety of observational and model artifacts to study\n    processes relating to mass and energy transfer across\n    different heliophysics domains. The Heliophysics Digital\n    Observatory (HDO) unifies several legacy discipline-oriented\n    heliophysics virtual observatories via a more streamlined and\n    intuitive middleware system that takes advantage of the Space\n    Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE) metadata and focuses on\n    delivering higher-level data search and discovery\n    capabilities beyond those of existing data services. SPASE\n    metadata enables HDO to search/discover, locate and access\n    multi-disciplinary data and model artifacts simultaneously\n    from distributed repositories. The HDO functionalities\n    supporting the NASA Heliophysics science goals are summarized below:\n    \n    1) Search, locate, and access multi-disciplinary heliophysics digital\n    resources (observational and model artifacts) to support research. \n    \n    2) Support systems science research by providing simultaneous access\n    to multi-disciplinary resources for multiple time intervals based \n    on (a) solar wind and geomagnetic conditions, (b) observing platform\n    locations, and (c) phenomenon-based event lists. \n    \n    3) The HDO built-in magnetospheric-state query system (MSQS) allows\n    resource searching by solar wind, IMF and geomagnetic conditions,\n    extreme or otherwise.\n      ",
