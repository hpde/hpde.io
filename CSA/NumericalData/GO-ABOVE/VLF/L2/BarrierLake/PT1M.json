The\r\n  Array for Broadband Observations of VLF/ELF Emissions (ABOVE)\r\n  Level-2 CDF files of Amplitude, Phase and Bearing at 1 minute\r\n  resolution for seven VLF transmitters as observed from each station\r\n  of the ABOVE array.  \r\n\r\n  The VLF transmitters observed are:\r\n   \r\n   NDK (LaMoure, North Dakota, 46.37 N, 98.33 W, 25.2 kHz)\r\n\r\n   NAA (Cutler, Maine,  44.64 N, 67.29 W, 24.0 kHz),\r\n   \r\n   NLK (Seattle, Washington, 48.20 N 121.92 W, 24.8 kHz)\r\n\r\n   NWC (Exmouth, Western Australia, 21.82 S, 114.16 E, 19.8 kHz)\r\n   \r\n   NPM (Lualualei, Hawaii, 21.42 N, 158.15 W, 21.4 kHz)\r\n\r\n   NRK (Keflavik, Iceland, 63.85 N, 22.45 W, 37.5 kHz)\r\n\r\n   WWVB (Fort Collins, Colorado, 40.68 N, 105.05 W, 60 kHz)\r\n\r\n   GO-ABOVE is a ground‐based array of VLF radio receivers located across Canada and run as a part of the Canadian Space Agency's Geospace Observatory (GO). The ABOVE instruments are situated in two north‐south chains in Alberta and Manitoba, through the region roughly from L = 3 through L = 8.  The ABOVE instruments monitor electromagnetic waves in a frequency range from 100 Hz to 75 kHz, covering chorus and hiss emissions as well as U.S. Navy transmitters near 25 kHz. The absolute timing accuracy is 10 ns, from GPS.    \r\n   ",
