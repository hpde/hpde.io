The ABOVE instruments are situated in two north‐south chains in Alberta and Manitoba, through the region roughly from L = 3 through L = 8.  The ABOVE instruments monitor electromagnetic waves in a frequency range from 100 Hz to 75 kHz, covering chorus and hiss emissions as well as U.S. Navy transmitters near 25 kHz. The absolute timing accuracy is 10 ns, from GPS.    \r\n   ",
