The filenames\r\n\t contain the date and time as well as an abbreviation for the\r\n\t station.\r\n\r\n\t GO-ABOVE is a ground‐based array of VLF radio receivers located across Canada and run as a\r\n\t part of the Canadian Space Agency's Geospace Observatory\r\n\t (GO). The ABOVE instruments are situated in two north‐south chains\r\n\t in Alberta and Manitoba, through the region roughly from L = 3\r\n\t through L = 8.  The ABOVE instruments monitor electromagnetic waves in a\r\n\t frequency range from 100 Hz to 75 kHz, covering chorus and hiss\r\n\t emissions as well as U.S. Navy transmitters near 25 kHz. The\r\n\t absolute timing accuracy is 10 ns, from GPS.",
