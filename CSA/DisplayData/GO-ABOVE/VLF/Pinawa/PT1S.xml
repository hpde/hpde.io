   <Description>GO-ABOVE the Geospace Observatory - Array for
   Broadband Observations of VLF/ELF Emissions, is a ground‐based
   array of VLF radio receivers located across Canada and run as a
   part of the Canadian Space Agency&#039;s Geospace Observatory
   (GO). The ABOVE instruments monitor electromagnetic waves in a
   frequency range from 100 Hz to 75 kHz, covering chorus and hiss
   emissions as well as U.S. Navy transmitters near 25 kHz.  

The summary plots span 1 second long and are taken 5 minutes apart
   from multiple stations in the GO-ABOVE array. Each plot contains 4
   dynamic spectrograms, two for the North-South antennas and two for
   the East-West antennas. For each pair one spectrogram spans a
   frequency range of 100 Hz to 10 kHz while the other spans from 100
   Hz to 75 kHz. Following the four dynamic spectrograms are two
   amplitude vs. time plots for the North-South and East-West
   antennas.

A directory tree structure allows access to these files. Each station
has a separate directory below the year, month and day. Within some of
the month directories is a data availability chart.
