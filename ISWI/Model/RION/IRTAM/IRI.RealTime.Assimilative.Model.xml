         <Description>IRI-based Real-Time Assimilative Model (IRTAM)
	 is a collection of global 3D ionospheric electron density
	 (Ne) computations produced every 15 minutes to follow the
	 timeline of the ionospheric weather dynamics. IRTAM 3D
	 belongs to a class of &quot;assimilative IRI&quot; models
	 that replace the internal coefficients of International
	 Reference Ionosphere (IRI), an empirical quiet-time model of
	 ionospheric climate with updated coefficients that are
	 obtained by smoothly transforming (&quot;morphing&quot;) IRI
	 into agreement with available observations. The observations
	 are provided in near-real-time by Global Ionosphere Radio
	 Observatory (GIRO) ionosondes. IRTAM 3D is a 4DVAR
	 assimilative model whose single computation provides the best
	 fit of the model to 24-hour history window of observations
	 prior to analysis time. Its underlying formalism of
	 representing Ne distributions is the same as in IRI: a set of
	 2D surface maps are computed to obtain the &quot;anchor&quot;
	 points of the 1D vertical extent of Ne at any location and
	 time.</Description>
         <Acknowledgement>Heavy investments of time, effort, expertise,
      and funds continue to be made to produce, collect, quality
      control, interpret, and archive ionosonde data. It is therefore
      important that the data suppliers and Lowell GIRO Data Center
      (LGDC) are appropriately acknowledged in scientific publications
      that include analysis of data obtained from LGDC servers.
