        "Description": "The broadband summary chart stitches together the\r\n   first second of each hour in the day. For VLF data  (100 kHz\r\n   sampling), the spectrogram will display from 0.3 kHz to 50\r\n   kHz. Note, these are not 24-hour-long spectrograms, but rather only\r\n   the first second of each hour (if available) is displayed. This\r\n   provides a quick and easy way to evaluate the operation of the\r\n   receiver and the noise environment, but more detailed analysis\r\n   requires downloading the actual data. \r\n\r\n   Each chart consists of two plots, the upper plot displays magnetic\r\n   field output from the North-South antenna, the lower plot displays\r\n   the magnetic field output from the East-West antenna. These are 24\r\n   Hour plots. The title of the chart indicates the name of the\r\n   station and the year-month-day of the observation.",
