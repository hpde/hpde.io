         <Description>The GIRO (Global Ionospheric Radio Observatory) comprises records of subpeak
ionospheric characteristics, including altitude profiles of electron 
density and plasma drift velocity, in the altitude range 90 km to the 
peak height of the F2 layer, measured by a global ground-based network 
of active high frequency (HF) radiowave remote sensing instruments, 
ionosondes. The ionosonde uses stepped- or fixed-frequency probing 
radio signals transmitted from the ground for propagation into ionosphere, 
total reflection from an area of matching plasma density, and return to 
the same or different ionosonde location for detection. The detected 
echoes are evaluated for their travel time and other characteristics 
such as amplitude, phase, polarization, Doppler frequency shift, and 
angle of arrival. The signal travel time is commonly translated to 
the virtual range to the reflecting area in the ionosphere in the 
assumption of the signal propagating at the speed of light.
Stepped-frequency measurements provide adequate information to compute
true range of reflections by accounting for refractive properties of plasma.

The ionosonde designs are commonly divided in two classes, (1) a pulsed sounder
with stepped frequency that transmits short pulses to detect the echo arrival
in the time domain, and (2) a chirp-sounder that transmits a continuous
swept-frequency signal to detect its reflections in the frequency domain.
The stepped- or swept-frequency sounders produce inherently 2-dimensional
data record (frequency x travel time), ionogram. Each element of the 2D
ionogram structure holds multiple signal characteristics measured in the
ionosonde&#039;s receiver channels. Thus acquired information is processed to
detect echoes and use their attributes to derive ionospheric characteristics
along the propagation path.

The fixed-frequency measurement, while using the same concept of radio
sounding by total reflection, targets specific plasma densities in the 
ionosphere, and usually provides higher Doppler frequency resolution by 
transmitting pulses at the same frequency for several seconds. 
Simultaneously occurring reflection points in a structured ionosphere 
are identified by their different echo Doppler frequencies allowing the
computation of Doppler skymaps and plasma drift velocity.</Description>
         <Acknowledgement>     Heavy investments of time, effort, expertise,
      and funds continue to be made to produce, collect, quality
      control, interpret, and archive ionosonde data. It is therefore
      important that the data suppliers and Lowell GIRO Data Center
      (LGDC) are appropriately acknowledged in scientific publications that include analysis of data obtained from LGDC servers.
