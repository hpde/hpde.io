        "Description": "Ionospheric Station at Fortaleza, Brazil; URSI-code: FZA0M.\n   Digisonde belongs to a class of advanced ionosondes that evaluate angle of arrival,\n   polarization, and Doppler frequency shift of skywave signals reflected from the ionosphere,\n   in addition to their travel time that is conventionally used to determine range to\n   the reflection point.",
        "Acknowledgement": "A heavy investment of time, effort, expertise, and funds continues to be made to produce, collect, quality control, interpret, and store digisonde ionograms. It is important that data suppliers and the UML DIDBase developers are appropriately acknowledged in scientific publications that involve analysis of data obtained from the Lowell DIDBase.",
