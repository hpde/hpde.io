        "Description": "GIRO provides accurate specification of the electron density in the Earth's\n      ionosphere at >60 locations in the world. 37 GIRO locations provide real-time ionospheric\n      data to the central server in Lowell, Massachusetts within several minutes. GIRO sites\n      are equipped by Digisonde instruments that use the high frequency remote sounding\n      technique to probe the bottomside ionosphere from 80 km up to the peak of ionospheric\n      plasma density. Real-time and retrospective data from GIRO locations are ingested in Lowell\n      Digital Ionogram DataBase (DIDBase) GIRO data are open for public access via DIDBase and\n      DriftBase Web Portals, and custom software tools for digisonde data analysis, SAO Explorer\n      and Drift Explorer.",
        "Acknowledgement": "Heavy investments of time, effort, expertise,\n      and funds continue to be made to produce, collect, quality\n      control, interpret, and archive ionosonde data. It is therefore\n      important that the data suppliers and Lowell GIRO Data Center\n      (LGDC) are appropriately acknowledged in scientific publications\n      that include analysis of data obtained from LGDC servers.\n\n      Please read Rules of the Road\n      https://giro.uml.edu/didbase/RulesOfTheRoad.html for license\n      information and refer to Acknowledgements List\n      https://giro.uml.edu/didbase/acknowledgements.htm to use GIRO\n      data per license requirements.\n      ",
