        "Description": "IRI-based Real-Time Assimilative Model (IRTAM)\r\n\t is a collection of global 3D ionospheric electron density\r\n\t (Ne) computations produced every 15 minutes to follow the\r\n\t timeline of the ionospheric weather dynamics. IRTAM 3D\r\n\t belongs to a class of &quot;assimilative IRI&quot; models\r\n\t that replace the internal coefficients of International\r\n\t Reference Ionosphere (IRI), an empirical quiet-time model of\r\n\t ionospheric climate with updated coefficients that are\r\n\t obtained by smoothly transforming (&quot;morphing&quot;) IRI\r\n\t into agreement with available observations. The observations\r\n\t are provided in near-real-time by Global Ionosphere Radio\r\n\t Observatory (GIRO) ionosondes. IRTAM 3D is a 4DVAR\r\n\t assimilative model whose single computation provides the best\r\n\t fit of the model to 24-hour history window of observations\r\n\t prior to analysis time. Its underlying formalism of\r\n\t representing Ne distributions is the same as in IRI: a set of\r\n\t 2D surface maps are computed to obtain the &quot;anchor&quot;\r\n\t points of the 1D vertical extent of Ne at any location and\r\n\t time.",
