        "Description": "GRAPE 1 DRF (Doppler Radio Frequency Receiver for the Great Radio Amateur Propagation Experiment) is a citizen science instrument that receives HF time-standard signals (e.g., WWV, WWVH, CHU) to measure Doppler shifts caused by ionospheric dynamics. Data is collected by volunteers using software-defined radios and GPS-disciplined oscillators, recorded in Digital RF (DRF) format, and contributed to the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) repository for space weather research.\r\n\r\nThe AD0RR is located at 37.188ºN, 93.292ºW. Instrument type is Grape 1 DRF. Antenna elevation is  396.0 degree. There is one antenna at this station, which is  Antenna 1: 80 meter 1/2 wave horizontal loop. It records 5MHz Doppler Shift.",
