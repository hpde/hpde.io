        "Description": "GRAPE 1 DRF (Doppler Radio Frequency Receiver for the Great Radio Amateur Propagation Experiment) is a citizen science instrument that receives HF time-standard signals (e.g., WWV, WWVH, CHU) to measure Doppler shifts caused by ionospheric dynamics. Data is collected by volunteers using software-defined radios and GPS-disciplined oscillators, recorded in Digital RF (DRF) format, and contributed to the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) repository for space weather research.\r\n\r\nThe Grape32 is located at 37.188ºN, 93.292ºW. Instrument type is Grape 1 DRF (Grape32). Antenna elevation is  300.0 degree. There is two antennas at this station, which are  Antenna 1: Shielded Loop and Antenna 2: 80 meter 1/2 wave horizontal loop. It records WWV 5MHz Doppler Shift (from 2023-08-23 to 2023-09-03) and WWV 10MHz Doppler Shift (from 2023-09-04 to present).",
