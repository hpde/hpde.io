        "Description": "GRAPE 1 DRF (Doppler Radio Frequency Receiver for the Great Radio Amateur Propagation Experiment) is a citizen science instrument that receives HF time-standard signals (e.g., WWV, WWVH, CHU) to measure Doppler shifts caused by ionospheric dynamics. Data is collected by volunteers using software-defined radios and GPS-disciplined oscillators, recorded in Digital RF (DRF) format, and contributed to the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) repository for space weather research.\r\n\r\nThe KD1LE node 43-2 is located at 42.646ºN, 71.625ºW. Instrument type is Grape 1 DRF. There is one antenna at this station, which is Antenna 1: 80 meter loop. It records 5MHz Doppler Shift.",
