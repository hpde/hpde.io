        "Description": "GRAPE 1 DRF (Doppler Radio Frequency Receiver for the Great Radio Amateur Propagation Experiment) is a citizen science instrument that receives HF time-standard signals (e.g., WWV, WWVH, CHU) to measure Doppler shifts caused by ionospheric dynamics. Data is collected by volunteers using software-defined radios and GPS-disciplined oscillators, recorded in Digital RF (DRF) format, and contributed to the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) repository for space weather research.\r\n\r\nThe AB1XB Node 51 DRF station is located at 27.771ºN, 80.375ºW. Instrument type is Grape 1 DRF. There is one antenna at this station, which is Antenna 1: MLA-30+ active loop. It records 10MHz Doppler Shift.",
