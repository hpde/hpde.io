        "Description": "GRAPE 1 DRF (Doppler Radio Frequency Receiver for the Great Radio Amateur Propagation Experiment) is a citizen science instrument that receives HF time-standard signals (e.g., WWV, WWVH, CHU) to measure Doppler shifts caused by ionospheric dynamics. Data is collected by volunteers using software-defined radios and GPS-disciplined oscillators, recorded in Digital RF (DRF) format, and contributed to the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) repository for space weather research.\r\n\r\nThe AB1XB Node 33 station is located at 42.521ºN, 71.542ºW. Instrument type is Grape 1 DRF. Antenna elevation is 137.0 degree. There are two antennas at this station, which are Antenna 1: 30m mag loop, and Antenna 2: 30m dipole. It records 10MHz Doppler Shift.",
