        "Description": "RX888 is a citizen science instrument that utilizes the RX-888 software-defined radio (SDR) to receive HF time-standard signals (e.g., WWV, WWVH, CHU) and amateur radio bands including 80 meters (~3.5–4.0 MHz), 40 meters (~7.0–7.3 MHz), 30 meters (~10.1–10.15 MHz), 20 meters (~14.0–14.35 MHz), 15 meters (~21.0–21.45 MHz), and 10 meters (~28.0–29.7 MHz). It is equipped with a GPS-disciplined oscillator (GPSDO) for high frequency stability and precision Doppler shift measurement. Data is recorded in Digital RF format by volunteers participating in the HamSCI Personal Space Weather Station (PSWS) project and contributed to the central PSWS repository for community-based space weather research. Frequencies listed are approximate and reflect typical U.S. amateur radio allocations in ITU Region 2.\r\n             \r\nThe K3LR station is located at 41.188ºN, 80.458ºW. Instrument type is RX888. There is no antenna information at this station. It records Doppler Shift of 2.500 MHz, 3.330 MHz, 5.000 MHz, 7.850 MHz, 10.000 MHz, 14.670 MHz, 15.000 MHz, and 20.000 MHz.",
