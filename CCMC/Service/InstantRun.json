        "Description": "The CCMC Instant-Run (IR) service allows users to execute a subset of CCMC hosted models and view the output immediately via the IR web interface. Note: not all CCMC hosted models are suitable or available for Instant-Run execution, and results of Instant-Run models are not stored/archived by CCMC.\n\nHow it works: Go to the Instant-Run (IR) system to see the list of models that the CCMC currently offers for instant execution. Click on the desired model name to see the submission interface for the model. Once the submission step is complete, results should be displayed almost immediately on the same web interface. Contact CCMC if you have any questions or trouble using our IR system.",
