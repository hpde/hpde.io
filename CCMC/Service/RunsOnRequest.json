        "Description": "The CCMC Runs-On-Request (ROR) service allow users to submit model execuation requests for a set of CCMC hosted models. \n\nHow it works: A model run request is submitted using our online interface. Once the request has been processed, an execution request is forwarded to the CCMC servers. These are, depending on the request, high-performance computing (HPC) clusters or Linux servers. After the requested ru is finished (generally between 1 day to 4 days), results are published on the CCMC website. At this time, an automatic email notification is sent to the requestor.",
