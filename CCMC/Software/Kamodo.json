        "Description": "Kamodo is an official NASA open-source project written in python that is built upon the functionalization of datasets. It is a CCMC developed and maintained software tool for access, interpolation, and visualization of space weather models and data. Kamodo allows model developers to represent simulation results as mathematical functions which may be manipulated directly by end users. Kamodo handles unit conversion transparently and supports interactive science discovery through jupyter notebooks with minimal coding. All Kamodo tools are accessible through python, and all source code is publicly available on the Kamodo NASA GitHub repositories.\n\nNote: Kamodo does not generate model outputs. Users need to acquire the desired model outputs before they can be functionalized by Kamodo.",
